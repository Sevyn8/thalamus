"""Wire shapes for ``POST /mapping-suggestions`` (LLM mapping-suggestion endpoint).

Request is the client-side column PROFILE (name, inferred datatype, null rate, a
few sample values); response is one suggestion per column, plus a ``source`` flag
(``llm`` when Gemini produced them, ``fallback`` when the mechanical matcher did)
so the UI labels honestly. ``suggested_target`` is always a catalog key or null;
the endpoint validates targets against the field catalog so the model cannot
invent a field. See docs/slices/llm-mapping-suggestion-contract.md.
