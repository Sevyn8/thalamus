"""The ``csv.received`` envelope (frozen contract) and the publisher seam.

The envelope model is field-for-field the committed
``contracts/pubsub/csv.received.schema.json``; the unit drift guard reconciles both
directions. This service POPULATES the contract, never changes its shape: identity
is the resolved internal UUIDs, the external codes ride as the optional
fields (producer-required when present), ``template_id`` is the validated
ACTIVE template, and ``upload_session_id`` is the deterministic per-upload
lineage id (a component of the worker's idempotency key —
see ``handlers/csv_uploads.py`` ``derive_upload_session_id``).

``Publisher`` is the seam tests inject against; ``PubsubPublisher`` is the runtime
implementation, emulator-or-ambient exactly like ``dis-storage``: the
emulator when ``PUBSUB_EMULATOR_HOST`` is set (the ``pubsub_v1`` client honours the
env var natively), real Pub/Sub via ambient service-account credentials when it is
not.
