"""``GET /dashboard/metrics`` - the tenant Dashboard's KPI + Flow reads (read-only).

Tenant from the verified token ONLY (no path/query parameter exists). The read goes
through ``repos/dashboard.py``, which opens one ``rls_session`` and runs pure
tenant-scoped aggregate SELECTs over audit.events, quarantine.*, and canonical.*.
No writes, no schema changes, no business logic beyond aggregation.

The quarantine block carries the raw counts (quarantined / received) alongside an
approximate ``rate`` (null when nothing was received in the window); the UI leads
with the raw count because the ratio is window-aligned, not a cohort rate.
