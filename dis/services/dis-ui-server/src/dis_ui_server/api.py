"""The ``/api/v1`` mount point for every UI data endpoint (durable invariant).

The prefix mechanism is a plain ``APIRouter(prefix=API_PREFIX)`` that
``main.py`` includes once; handlers attach their routers here and inherit the
deployed base without restating it. The contract's relative
``/v1/<group>/<resource>`` paths are unchanged (only the deployed base is
``/api/v1``), and dis-ui's ``client.ts`` fetch base must agree when the
frontend's real mode wires up (13b/19, contract Appendix B; flagged to the UI
engineer). Health probes deliberately do NOT live here: ``/healthz`` and
``/readyz`` stay at the root per infra convention.

Slice 14b mounts the first data endpoints: the store list, the field catalog,
and the mapping-template resource. Slice 8 mounts the synchronous CSV upload.
