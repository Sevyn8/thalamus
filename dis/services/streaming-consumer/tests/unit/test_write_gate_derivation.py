"""Slice 16h: the write-time completeness required set is MODEL-DERIVED.

``HOT_REQUIRED_FROM_PROJECTION`` is no longer a hand-curated literal — it is
``mandatory_mapping_produced(StoreSkuCurrentPosition, enrichment_guaranteed=…)``
(required-in-model ∩ mapping_produced, minus the enrichment value-guaranteed fields),
the same derivation the create-time gate uses. Two guarantees:

- **No behaviour change (T1):** the derived set yields IDENTICAL COMPLETE/INCOMPLETE
  verdicts to the old hand-curated literal across the mapping matrix — the difference
  ({sku_id}) is inert because guaranteed_hot_columns always covers sku_id (in every
  mapping's targets). Slice 16i subtracted currency from the required set (its value is
  enrichment-guaranteed); the enrichment union still covers it on the guaranteed side, so
  verdicts are unchanged either way. Slice 16j made product_category + unit_cost nullable,
  which DELIBERATELY changes the verdict for a snapshot omitting them (now COMPLETE) — so
  that case was retired from this T1 matrix (it is no longer behaviour-preserving against
  the pre-16h literal); its new behaviour is asserted by the reduced-set test and the
  catalogue-write e2e instead. The remaining matrix still reproduces the literal exactly.
- **Hot-model pin (T4):** the set is keyed to the hot/current-position model, NEVER
  the routed target_model — the one real trap, invisible to verdict tests (for events
  the required and guaranteed sets are disjoint, both give False either way), so it is
  asserted structurally here.
