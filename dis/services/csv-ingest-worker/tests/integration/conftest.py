"""Fixtures for the worker integration tests.

These tests WRITE the DIS database and use the Pub/Sub + GCS emulators, so
they must NOT skip silently when the stack is absent: a missing
env or unreachable emulator is a loud ERROR (``StackRequiredError``), never a skip.
Everything runs against ``ithina_dis_db`` on 5433; Customer Master (5432) is never
touched.

Each test mints a UNIQUE ``upload_session_id``/``trace_id`` pair (the test plays
dis-ui-server, the upstream producer — the WORKER under test still only reads them)
so the 24h dedup window cannot couple test runs; created bronze/audit rows are
deleted in teardown via the admin engine.
