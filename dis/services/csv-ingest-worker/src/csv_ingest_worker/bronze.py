"""The bronze sink: dedup lookup, the one metadata-only INSERT, and the publish mark.

Every statement here runs on a connection yielded by ``dis-rls`` ``rls_session``
under the EVENT's tenant (hard rules 1 & 12) — tenant scoping is the RLS policy's
(``bronze.data_ingress_events`` is FORCE RLS, ``tenant_isolation`` USING + WITH
CHECK on ``app.tenant_id``), inherited target guard included
(``current_database()=='ithina_dis_db'``, NOBYPASSRLS; DIS on 5433, never CM).

Metadata only: pointer, identity, hash, counts, status. NEVER payload bytes, never
cell values (hard rule 2).

Idempotency key (D54 / build-guide): ``(tenant, source_payload_id=upload_session_id,
payload_sha256)`` within ``DEDUP_WINDOW_HOURS`` measured against the prior row's
``received_at``. The key components are required values — empty ones raise
``EventContractError`` here as the last line even though the envelope already
enforces them (code-quality rule 4: never a silent fallback). The pre-9b smoke rows
carry NULL ``source_payload_id``/``payload_sha256`` and can never match the
non-NULL equality.

CONCURRENCY (registered in decisions.md D58): the check is query-based — there is
no UNIQUE constraint over the key (a 24h *window* cannot be a plain unique index) —
so it is correct for a SINGLE worker instance. Scaling to concurrent instances
requires a constraint/upsert design first.
