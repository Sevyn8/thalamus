"""The inbound ``csv.received`` envelope, typed against the frozen contract.

One Pydantic model per the committed ``contracts/pubsub/csv.received.schema.json``
(read and populate, never change shape). The unit drift guard
reconciles this model's field set against the contract file both directions, so a
contract edit and this model cannot silently diverge.

A contract violation (missing/empty/malformed required field — including the
idempotency-key component ``upload_session_id``) raises ``EventContractError``
(required values never fall back silently). Terminal for the
message: a redelivery of the same malformed envelope fails identically.
