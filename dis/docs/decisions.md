# DIS Design Decisions Register

**Status:** companion to `architecture.md`. This doc carries the indexed register of architecture-level decisions. Architecture prose, modules, data flow, and constraints live in `architecture.md`; the visual diagram lives in `architecture.html`.

**Scope:** decisions that shape the system at the architecture level — choice of managed services, transport patterns, persistence semantics, isolation posture. Implementation-level decisions (which Python library, which Pydantic config) do NOT belong here.

**Numbering.** Sequential; each decision keeps its number forever even if revised or superseded. Category labels in the title are advisory and ungated (`[STORAGE]`, `[INGRESS]`, etc.). Cross-references from other docs use the bare `D1`-`DN` form.

**Revision lifecycle.** Decisions can be revised when the system context warrants; the original decision is preserved with strikethrough or marked "superseded by Dxx" rather than rewritten. Decisions that are still pending are labeled `OPEN`.

**Open-question identifiers.** Major open questions raised in earlier revisions (B1, B2, B3, D1, D2, D5, G1, G3, G4) are referenced by their original IDs throughout DIS docs; they map to the decision register as follows: B1 → D22, D1 → D4, D2 → D4a, D5 → D25, G1 → D24, G3 → D27, G4 → D28. B2 and B3 remain open (see end of register).

### D1 GCP managed-first, not self-hosted
**Decision.** Build on GCP managed services (Pub/Sub, Dataflow, Cloud SQL, BigQuery, Cloud Scheduler, container runtime) wherever they fit; write custom code only for the irreducible middle (mapping, RLS-aware sink, receivers, identity).
**Alternatives.** Self-hosted Kafka + Flink + Postgres + ClickHouse on GKE; third-party managed (Confluent, Snowflake, Fivetran).
**Why.** The team's stated goal is "accelerate development, low maintenance". Self-hosted stacks demand ongoing ops (HA, upgrades, on-call) that don't show up in initial estimates. Third-party managed brings vendor sprawl and data-residency concerns Ithina can't yet evaluate. GCP-native means one bill, one IAM model, one observability stack.

### D2 Push model for ingress, not pull
**Decision.** Sources push to Ithina-owned receivers (API, webhook, CSV POST endpoint, manual upload UI). The reverse-API case is the only pull, and even there the response body lands at a receiver.
**Alternatives.** Scheduled polling (Cloud Scheduler hitting tenant systems); CDC-based pull (Datastream off tenant DBs).
**Why.** Latency target is few seconds. Polling cadence cannot meet it without near-continuous polls, which is wasteful. CDC requires tenants to expose their internals, which is operationally and contractually expensive. Push is the natural fit for event-driven retail data and keeps Ithina in control of the ingress surface.

### D3 Pub/Sub as the only message bus
**Decision.** All inter-component asynchronous communication goes through Pub/Sub. No Kafka, no in-process queues, no DB-as-queue patterns.
**Alternatives.** Kafka (if already present in the org); Cloud Tasks; direct service-to-service calls.
**Why.** Pub/Sub is GCP-native, scales transparently to thousands of messages per second, provides at-least-once delivery with optional exactly-once subscriptions, and integrates natively with Dataflow and containerized consumers. Kafka would add a second messaging system to operate. Cloud Tasks lacks fan-out semantics needed for audit and quarantine branching.

### D4 Streaming runtime (D1)
**Decision.** A containerised service is the streaming consumer. The transformation logic is factored as pure functions over `(mapping, raw_row) → canonical_row`, so a future migration to a higher-throughput runtime is a runner swap, not a rewrite.
**Migration trigger.** Sustained 500+ rows/sec for 7 days, OR scaling above 20 concurrent service instances, OR p95 end-to-end above 10 seconds. First trigger wins. Apache Beam on Dataflow is the documented destination at scale.
**Alternatives.** Always-on Dataflow from day one; Cloud Data Fusion (visual ETL); Dataform (SQL-based, batch); per-tenant streaming jobs.
**Why a containerised service today.** Dataflow streaming carries a baseline cost (always-on workers, $150-300/month at low volume) that is real overhead at the current scale, when traffic is bursty and modest. A containerised service scales to zero between bursts, costs near nothing at single-digit RPS, and runs the same Python code. Hand-rolled consumers can be cheaper at low volume.
**Why Dataflow at scale.** Beam's native exactly-once dedup, side-input refresh, bundle-level batching, autoscaling, dead-letter routing, and watermarking become real value at thousands of rows/sec. The engineering time to build, tune, and maintain equivalents on a hand-rolled consumer exceeds the Dataflow bill.
**Why this is not lock-in.** The transformation logic is pure functions in shared libraries (`libs/dis-mapping`, `libs/dis-validation`). The current consumer wraps these in a Pub/Sub subscriber loop; a future Beam pipeline wraps the same functions in DoFns. The migration is a runner swap. Pandera works in both runtimes (D4a).
**Tradeoff acknowledged.** The current consumer lacks Beam's native exactly-once and bundling; it implements simpler versions: at-least-once with idempotent canonical writes, manual batching of ~500 rows per tenant transaction. Acceptable at the current scale; suboptimal at growth.

### D4a Validation library: Pandera, not Great Expectations (D2)
**Decision.** Pandera is the validation library. Used for both pre-mapping (source-shape) and post-mapping (canonical-shape) suites.
**Alternatives.** Great Expectations (GE); hand-rolled rule engine.
**Why Pandera over GE.** Lower latency on the hot path (no Data Docs generation on every run; suites are Python objects, not file-backed). Better fit for Beam DoFns when streaming migrates to Dataflow (Pandera schemas are pure-Python and serializable). Lower ceremony per suite (a Pandera schema is ~20 lines; a GE expectation suite is a JSON file with 5x the boilerplate). The DIS UI quarantine console is built in-house, which makes GE's Data Docs (a major GE selling point) less load-bearing.
**Why not hand-rolled.** A library earns its place when the rule set is large enough that declarative configuration and tenant-readable failure reasons matter more than the dependency cost. Across many tenants with diverse sources, the rule set will be large.
**Storage.** Pandera suites are versioned per `(tenant_id, source_id, version)` and referenced from `config.source_mappings`.

### D5 Bronze first, transform second
**Decision.** The receiver writes the enriched payload to bronze (Postgres + GCS) before publishing to Pub/Sub. The pipeline consumes from bronze, not from the live request.
**Alternatives.** Receiver synchronously calls the pipeline; receiver publishes directly to Pub/Sub without bronze write; in-memory passthrough.
**Why.** Bronze is the audit trail and replay source. Without it, a tenant resubmit or an Ithina-side replay has nothing to re-process. The write-then-publish ordering also means Pub/Sub message loss is recoverable: bronze rows can be re-published by a sweeper job.

### D6 Three-class canonical (hot + events + signals)
**Decision.** Canonical splits into three classes of table:
1. **Hot table** (`store_sku_current_position`): one row per SKU instance, upserted, current state.
2. **Event tables** (`store_sku_sale_events`, `store_sku_change_events`): partitioned by `event_date`, daily partitions, 35-day rolling retention in Cloud SQL (configurable).
3. **Signal history** (`store_sku_signal_history`): append-only daily history of computed derived attributes; one row per SKU per as_of_date. Same 35-day retention default.
**Alternatives.** Single table with `is_current` flag; pure event-sourced model with derived views; hot-only with separate audit log; canonical events in BigQuery only (no Cloud SQL buffer).
**Why this split.** Hot table serves ROOS reads with low latency on a manageable row count. Event tables capture detail for downstream analytics and replay; partitioned by date for cheap eviction. Signal history makes daily derived-attribute compute incremental (yesterday's row + 1 day of events) instead of full-window recomputation, and preserves daily values for backtesting. Each class earns its place by serving a different read pattern at the right cost.
**Why Cloud SQL events buffer with 35-day retention.** Atomic dual-write (hot + events) inside one Cloud SQL transaction is structurally simpler than coordinating Cloud SQL + BQ writes. 35-day retention gives ops a long replay window in familiar SQL without forcing them to BigQuery for recent investigations. At beta scale (~150K events/day), 35 days = ~5M rows in Cloud SQL; manageable. See §4.30.

### D7 Event-time wins, not arrival-time
**Decision.** Hot-table upserts are conditional: a row is overwritten only if the incoming event's `source_event_timestamp` is newer than the stored value. Late-arriving older events are appended to event tables but do not touch the hot table.
**Alternatives.** Last-arrival-wins (simpler); field-level conflict resolution per source.
**Why.** Retail data arrives out of order in the real world (network blips, batched ERP exports, replay events). Arrival-time semantics would let stale data clobber fresh state. Event-time semantics give correctness without requiring strict in-order delivery, which Pub/Sub does not guarantee.

### D8 Column-scoped merge upsert
**Decision.** A single canonical row is the union of fields contributed by multiple sources. Each source declares the canonical columns it owns; an upsert touches only those columns.
**Alternatives.** Row-replace on every upsert; one canonical row per (key, source) tuple.
**Why.** A POS event carries sale-related fields; an ERP event carries inventory-related fields; a planogram update carries placement fields. Row-replace would force every source to know every column, or destroy data from other sources on every write. Per-source rows would push the merge logic to read time, hurting query performance.

### D9 Nightly BQ offload, not live fan-out
**Decision.** History rows are written only to Cloud SQL on the hot path. A nightly batch job (during retail off-hours) copies yesterday's slice to BigQuery and evicts rows older than the configured retention window from Cloud SQL. **The original "3 months" retention has been superseded by D29 (35-day configurable buffer); this decision is retained for the architectural pattern (nightly copy + delayed evict), but the window value is D29's.**
**Alternatives.** Live dual-write from Beam to both Cloud SQL and BigQuery; CDC from Cloud SQL to BigQuery (Datastream); BigQuery as the sole history store.
**Why.** Live dual-write adds latency to the canonical write path (BigQuery streaming inserts have variable latency and cost). The team's analytics tolerance is 24 hours, so nightly is sufficient. The no-ingress window during retail off-hours is a natural batch window. CDC is one more managed service to operate when the simple batch job suffices.

### D10 Identity store on a physically separate database
**Decision.** Tenant and store metadata lives in a separate Postgres instance owned by the admin app. The data platform never connects to it directly.
**Alternatives.** Co-locate identity data in the canonical DB; foreign data wrapper across instances.
**Why.** Physical separation is an organizational requirement (different blast radius, different ownership, different backup cadence). FDW makes the separation a lie at the query level and has unpredictable performance.

### D11 Identity Service in front of Customer Master
**Decision.** All identity reads from the data platform go through a Tenant/Store Identity Service (containerized service with a cache). Direct Customer Master access from data-platform services is forbidden.
**Alternatives.** Each data-platform service calls Customer Master directly; embed identity in JWT claims everywhere; replicate Customer Master into the data-platform DB and read locally.
**Why.** Caching belongs in one place; identity is read on every request and would crush Customer Master otherwise. Centralizing also gives one place to enforce auth, audit identity reads, and publish change events. JWT claims handle the API/webhook channels but not internal/reverse-API channels, so a service is still needed.

### D12 Mirror table + real FK as the cross-DB integrity substitute
**Decision.** A small `identity_mirror` schema in the data-platform Postgres holds `tenants` and `stores`, populated by a consumer subscribed to `identity.changed`. Canonical tables have real Postgres FKs pointing to these mirror tables.
**Alternatives.** Application-layer validation only; trigger-based validation function; deferred constraints; no validation at the DB layer.
**Why.** True cross-DB FK is impossible. Application-layer validation is bypassable by bugs and direct DB writes. The mirror gives real FK semantics with real error messages, real cascade rules, and zero per-write network calls. The cost is a small replication lag (seconds), handled by retry-with-backoff at the sink and a fallback to quarantine if the mirror never catches up.

### D13 Receiver permissive, pipeline strict
**Decision.** Receivers accept anything that is structurally valid (auth passes, payload parseable). Semantic validation happens in the pipeline; failures go to quarantine, not back to the tenant.
**Alternatives.** Strict receiver (reject on first semantic issue); strict pipeline that halts on failure.
**Why.** Strict receivers force tenants to debug synchronously, which is hostile to ERP systems that cannot easily handle 4xx responses. Permissive receivers + downstream quarantine gives tenants asynchronous, batched feedback through a UI, which matches how their ops teams actually work. The pipeline is strict because it owns the canonical contract.

### D14 Audit by trace_id, end to end
**Decision.** Every ingress chunk is assigned a `trace_id` at the receiver. Every stage in the pipeline emits a structured audit row to BigQuery keyed by `trace_id`. Debugging is a single SQL query.
**Alternatives.** Log-based audit (Cloud Logging only); per-stage tables; sampled tracing.
**Why.** Logs are unstructured and hard to query by row. Per-stage tables fragment the trail. Sampling loses the row a tenant is asking about. A single audit_events table keyed by trace_id is queryable, joinable, and cheap in BigQuery.

### D15 Mapping config in Postgres, not Firestore
**Decision.** Per-(tenant, source) mapping rules live in a `config.source_mappings` table in the data-platform Postgres, versioned, edited via the admin app.
**Alternatives.** Firestore; YAML files in GCS; hardcoded per-source modules in Beam.
**Why.** The admin app already lives in Postgres; same data shape, same tooling, same auth, same backups. Firestore would be a second datastore for the same kind of data. YAML in GCS loses transactional editing and FK integrity to tenant/source. Hardcoded modules turn new-source onboarding into a deploy.

### D16 DuckDB optional; Pandera committed
**Decision.** DuckDB is recommended but not required. Pandera is the committed validation engine (§4.4a, §4.21).
**Why DuckDB remains optional.** DuckDB pre-flight in receivers and ops query panel in dis-ui-server are both achievable with custom CSV parsing and ad-hoc BQ queries respectively. DuckDB makes them cheaper and faster; not adopting it adds engineering effort, not correctness risk.
**Why Pandera is no longer optional.** See §4.4a. The reasoning that made it the marginal favorite in v0 became load-bearing once latency targets (§2.4) and Cloud Run runtime (§4.4) were pinned. v1.0 ships with Pandera.

### D17 Assisted source onboarding, with staged rollout
**Decision.** Onboarding a new source is hybrid: system proposes the mapping based on sample data, a human operator reviews and approves. New mappings start in a `staged` state and are validated in shadow mode against live traffic before being promoted to `active`.
**Alternatives.** Fully manual onboarding (operator writes every mapping from scratch); fully automated (LLM generates and auto-activates mappings); per-source-type hardcoded mappings.
**Why.** Fully manual is slow and the bottleneck scales with tenant growth. Fully automated is risky: a wrong mapping silently corrupts canonical data, and the cost of catching it later is high. Hardcoded per-source-type mappings break the moment a tenant runs a customized version of a standard POS/ERP, which is the norm. The assisted approach gets ~60-75% of column matches right on first try with rule-based heuristics (more with historical learning), reducing operator effort to reviewing and correcting, not authoring. Staged rollout means a bad mapping cannot harm production canonical data; it writes only to a staging schema until promoted.

### D18 Validation split into pre-mapping and post-mapping
**Decision.** Validation runs in two stages, not one. A pre-mapping stage validates the source-shape (does the incoming chunk look like what we expect from this source?). A post-mapping stage validates the canonical-shape (does the mapped row satisfy canonical invariants?). Both stages use Pandera but operate on different vocabularies and produce different failure types.
**Alternatives.** Single post-mapping validation stage (simpler, but conflates two failure modes); single pre-mapping validation stage only (misses canonical-shape bugs and business invariant violations).
**Why.** Source-shape failures (missing column, wrong type, truncated upload) and canonical-shape failures (negative inventory, event_ts in the future, FK to unknown store) have different root causes, different remedies, and different audiences. Catching source-shape problems before mapping means the failure reason is intelligible to the tenant ("expected column `item_code`, got `itemcd`") rather than a misleading downstream symptom ("`sku_id` is null"). It also avoids spending compute on mapping a chunk that was malformed at the source. Two stages keep each suite small, focused, and tenant-readable. The cost is two suite-author tasks during onboarding instead of one, mitigated by the onboarding service generating both drafts from the sample.

### D19 Neutral compute platform language
**Decision.** The architecture is described in terms of *containerized services* (long-running) and *containerized jobs* (one-shot), not a specific compute platform. Deployment platform (managed serverless, self-managed orchestration, or anything else) is an implementation choice left to the operator.
**Alternatives.** Specify a single compute platform (Cloud Run, GKE, etc.) throughout the design.
**Why.** The architecture's correctness does not depend on the compute platform. Pinning the design to one platform creates noise when the team's actual platform choice differs, and forces re-explanation of every container's runtime when the team migrates platforms. Neutral language keeps the document portable across deployment choices.

### D20 Data normalization as a distinct sub-stage, declarative with escape hatch
**Decision.** Normalization is a distinct sub-stage in the mapping step, sitting between rename and cast: `rename -> normalize -> cast -> derive`. It handles format variance (date formats, decimal separators, timezones, units, enums, boolean encodings, null encodings, casing, whitespace) per source, driven by a declarative `transforms` field in the mapping config. A bounded vocabulary of normalizers (`parse_date`, `parse_decimal`, `parse_boolean`, `lookup_enum`, `normalize_currency`, `trim_and_collapse_whitespace`, etc.) covers the common cases. For source-specific quirks the declarative vocabulary can't express, the mapping can reference a named custom transform function deployed in the Beam pipeline (the escape hatch).
**Alternatives.** Hand-wave normalization inside "apply mapping" (current implicit state, gap in the design); fully declarative DSL with no escape hatch (covers ~80% of cases, breaks on the rest); fully code-based per-source transforms (no declarative path, every new source needs a deploy).
**Why.** Format variance is the norm, not the exception: tenants run software from different regions, vendors, and decades. Without an explicit normalization stage, format failures surface late (cast errors, business-invariant violations) with misleading reasons. A bounded declarative vocabulary handles the bulk of cases through config edits, keeping onboarding throughput high. The escape hatch handles the long tail without forcing every quirk into config syntax. Placement before cast is mandatory: `cast("23,45", float)` fails on European decimals, `cast(normalize("23,45"), float)` succeeds. Normalization failures route to quarantine as a distinct failure type ("normalization failed: column X, value Y, expected format Z"), separate from source-shape and canonical-shape failures, giving tenants a clear, narrow reason to act on.

### D21 Validation engine: Pandera
**Decision.** Pandera is the validation engine. Reasons in D4a. Wherever the architecture document carries "GE/Pandera" wording, treat as Pandera; the historical record is retained for context only.

### D22 Mapping version pinning on canonical rows
**Decision.** Every mapping-produced canonical row carries a `mapping_version_id BIGINT NOT NULL` column: the hot table (`store_sku_current_position`) and both event tables (`store_sku_sale_events`, `store_sku_change_events`). The streaming consumer stamps this column with the mapping version that produced the row.
**Scope: signal_history excluded by design.** `store_sku_signal_history` is daily-compute output derived from already-canonical rows, not produced by the mapping engine (D31, D32); it carries no `mapping_version_id`, its provenance is `trace_id` plus `compute_metadata`. The "hot and history" phrasing referred to the event (history-tier) tables, not signal_history.
**Replay default.** Replay uses the mapping version recorded on the original row, not current active. Ops can override to "current active" with an explicit flag, and the audit trail records both versions.
**Alternatives considered.** No version on canonical rows (which would silently produce audit drift). Mapping version stored only in audit (cheaper to add but reconstruction requires audit join on every dispute, and audit can be incomplete after retention expires).
**Why.** Audit and replay are load-bearing in a multi-tenant ETL platform. Without mapping version on the canonical row, "why does this row look wrong" cannot be answered cleanly (source bug vs mapping bug vs business rule). Replay against current mapping produces different canonical results than the original, undetectable post-hoc. Adding one column now costs one Alembic migration; adding it after history accumulates means rewriting analytics queries, dbt models, replay tooling, and re-explaining historical canonical values per tenant.
**Downstream contract impact.** `quarantine` Pub/Sub schema carries `mapping_version_id` for post-mapping failures. `pipeline.dlq` carries `mapping_version_ids` for batch recovery (recovery pins to original versions). `mapping.changed` carries `mapping_version_id` as primary identifier. Audit events carry `mapping_version_id` on every post-mapping stage.

### D23 Alembic for Postgres schema migrations; dbt for BigQuery analytics
**Decision.** Alembic is the migration tool for every Postgres schema in DIS: canonical, config, bronze, identity_mirror, quarantine, staging. dbt is scoped to BigQuery: `canonical_history.*` models built from the nightly batch slice, and data tests via `dbt-expectations` on freshness, completeness, and referential integrity in BigQuery.
**Why Alembic for Postgres.** Battle-tested for Postgres DDL including the features DIS uses (enum types, CHECK constraints, partial indexes, triggers, RLS policies). Migrations are reversible by design (every migration has `upgrade()` and `downgrade()`). Python aligns with the rest of the DIS stack (FastAPI services, Pandera, codegen). Same tool used by Customer Master; consistent within Sevyn8.
**Why dbt for BigQuery only.** dbt is built for analytics SQL. BigQuery models, derived tables, data tests are dbt's strengths. Alembic does not speak BigQuery natively. Clean separation: each tool in its area of strength.
**Alternatives considered.** dbt for both (rejected: poor fit for Postgres operational features including RLS and triggers, forward-only, no rollback). Alembic for both (rejected: Alembic doesn't speak BigQuery). Flyway / Liquibase (rejected: JVM dependency, off-stack). Raw SQL migrations (rejected: no version tracking, no rollback).
**New canonical column flow.** (1) Alembic migration adds the column with default. (2) Backfill from history in a separate Alembic migration or one-off script. (3) Per-tenant mapping configs updated to populate the new column. (4) `mapping.changed` published; streaming consumer side-input refresh picks up the change. (5) Corresponding dbt model in BigQuery `canonical_history.*` is updated to project the new column.

### D24 PII tokenization at the receiver, not the pipeline (G1)
**Decision.** All PII fields (phone, email, loyalty_id, PAN, Aadhaar, and tenant-policy fields) are tokenized via deterministic HMAC with per-tenant keys at the receiver, before any persistence. Bronze and canonical never carry raw PII.
**Alternatives.** Tokenize in the pipeline (after bronze write); tokenize at query time via column-level encryption; store raw PII with row-level access control.
**Why at the receiver.** Bronze is the audit/replay source; if raw PII lands in bronze, every audit query and replay carries the leak risk. Right-to-erasure (DPDPA, GDPR) becomes a key-vault delete, not a multi-table scrub. Per-tenant key prevents cross-tenant join-inference attacks.
**Why deterministic HMAC.** Deterministic so joins on tokenized fields still work (e.g., "how many times has this customer-token visited?"). HMAC because it is keyed (per-tenant), one-way, and has standard library support.
**Key rotation.** Token vault carries a key version. Rotation produces a new token namespace; old tokens remain joinable within their version. Migration to new tokens is a per-tenant batch operation.

### D25 Customer Master as external dependency (D5)
**Decision.** Customer Master (Sevyn8's Auth0-integrated identity, auth, and RBAC system) is the single source of truth for user identity and authorization. DIS does not maintain user records. DIS UI accepts Customer Master tokens; dis-ui-server validates them.
**Alternatives.** DIS maintains its own user table; DIS uses Auth0 directly.
**Why.** Customer Master is reused across Sevyn8 products. Duplicating user records in DIS creates synchronization burden and policy drift. Auth0-direct would skip the RBAC layer Customer Master provides and force DIS to reimplement role policies.
**What is still open.** Token format and verification semantics (likely JWT with JWKS) and the RBAC claim vocabulary DIS expects from Customer Master are the remaining contracts to pin in Phase 0. Frontend DIS UI integration with Customer Master is delivered.

### D26 dis-ui-server as backend-for-frontend (BFF) for DIS UI
**Decision.** A single containerized service, `dis-ui-server`, is the only backend the DIS UI calls. Per-sub-module handlers inside (auth, sample upload, onboarding review, mapping CRUD, quarantine console, audit lookup, DuckDB query panel). Onboarding work (schema inference, mapping suggestion, validation draft, shadow rollout) lives in-process as a sub-module of dis-ui-server, not as a separate service.
**Alternatives.** Per-domain APIs (one service per UI surface); growing HTTP APIs on existing data-plane services (identity-service, quarantine-drainer, etc.); separate onboarding-service.
**Why one BFF.** One Customer Master integration point. One URL the UI calls. Per-domain APIs multiply auth integrations and deploy units for no v0 benefit. Growing HTTP on data-plane services couples them to UI lifecycle and CM auth.
**Why onboarding in-process.** dis-ui-server is the only caller of onboarding work. CPU profile of sample inference does not warrant process isolation. If onboarding work later blocks BFF latency, the sub-module structure (inference/, suggestion/, validation_draft/, shadow/) is designed for clean extraction.
**What dis-ui-server never does.** Never writes to canonical tables. Never handles Pub/Sub messages on the ingress/quarantine path. Reads from Cloud SQL read replica + config + quarantine + BQ audit. Writes only to `config.source_mappings`.

### D27 Streaming consumer backpressure: circuit breaker + DLQ (G3)
**Decision.** The streaming consumer probes Cloud SQL health (`SELECT 1`, 100ms timeout) before each batch commit. On unhealthy state, batches divert to `pipeline.dlq` topic. Receivers monitor DLQ depth; when threshold crosses, receivers return 503 + `Retry-After` to back off upstream producers.
**Alternatives.** Block-and-retry inside the consumer (risks queue depth blow-up); drop and lose (unacceptable); manual circuit break (slow operator response).
**Why.** Automatic backpressure that propagates upstream without losing data. DLQ is recoverable: when Cloud SQL health restores, a recovery process drains DLQ entries with graduated retry to avoid thundering herd. See §15 (B3) for performance isolation; this is the infrastructure-failure complement.

### D28 Identity Service stale-while-error fallback (G4)
**Decision.** Identity Service serves cache hits up to 5 minutes stale on Customer Master errors. Streaming consumer `validate()` calls fall back to direct `identity_mirror` read when Identity Service circuit is open. Resolve methods (`resolve_from_token`, etc.) cannot fall back (lookup requires Customer Master); they return errors that callers handle as 503.
**Why.** Customer Master is a hard dependency on the hot path. A 5-minute stale window keeps the platform writable during transient Customer Master outages. Acknowledged tradeoff: a tenant deactivated during the stale window may write data for up to 5 minutes after deactivation; downstream RLS still scopes the data, so isolation is not broken.

### D29 BigQuery as long-term archive; Cloud SQL holds 35-day buffer
**Decision.** BigQuery is the permanent archive for canonical history. Cloud SQL holds a 35-day rolling buffer of events and signal history (configurable). Daily Cloud SQL → BigQuery export runs from day 1; partitions are dropped from Cloud SQL only after the retention window elapses.
**Alternatives considered.** Cloud SQL holds 3 months (original position); Cloud SQL holds 24h buffer with same-day BQ export and partition drop (interim posture); direct-to-BQ via Pub/Sub with no Cloud SQL events.
**Why.** At v1.0 beta scale (~150K events/day across 5 tenants × ~25 stores), Cloud SQL handles ~5M event rows comfortably with appropriate partitioning. A 24-hour buffer would be conservative; designed for 100M events/day worst case. 35 days gives ops a useful replay window in SQL without crossing to BQ; ROOS and dis-ui-server can read recent history from Cloud SQL.
**Why the retention is configurable.** Different deployments and scale points warrant different windows. Beta runs at 35 days; production at scale may reduce to 7-14 days; stress test at 24 hours. The eviction job reads the retention parameter; no schema change required.
**Cadence.** Daily eviction job runs every day. From day 1: copies yesterday's partition to BigQuery (idempotent WRITE_TRUNCATE). From day N+retention: drops partitions older than retention.
**Replay window.** 35 days in Cloud SQL. Beyond that, replay reads from BigQuery; the streaming consumer reprocesses BQ-sourced events through the pipeline.
**Schema-side implication.** None. The canonical event tables already partition by event_date. Only the eviction job's behavior changes.

### D30 Atomic dual-write to Cloud SQL (hot + events)
**Decision.** The streaming consumer writes both the hot table upsert AND the matching event-table insert in a single Cloud SQL transaction. RLS context (`SET LOCAL app.tenant_id`) covers both writes. On rollback, neither side lands.
**Alternatives.** Two-phase commit across Cloud SQL + BQ; eventual-consistency dual-write with reconciliation; events-only with current state derived; current-state-only with events derived from change log.
**Why.** One transaction is the structurally simplest correctness model. Either-or-neither semantics avoid the partial-write problem entirely. Pub/Sub at-least-once delivery is handled by event-table dedup semantics, not by transactional idempotency; see D33. The event-table write fits inside the same per-tenant batched canonical commit at no meaningful latency cost.
**Tradeoff acknowledged.** The hot-table write path is now coupled to the event-table's availability. If the event-table partition has lock contention or autovacuum stall, the hot write also stalls. Mitigated by partitioning events by date (no global hot partition) and per-tenant transaction batching.

### D31 Daily compute job: Postgres-local, incremental
**Decision.** Derived attributes (`velocity_7day`, `stock_age_days`, `unit_cost_trend_30day`, etc.) are computed daily by a scheduled job that runs in Cloud SQL Postgres, not in BigQuery. The job reads:
1. **Yesterday's signal row** from `canonical.store_sku_signal_history` (the most recent as_of_date prior to today).
2. **Today's events** from `canonical.store_sku_sale_events` and `canonical.store_sku_change_events` (within the Cloud SQL retention window).

And produces today's signal row, then updates `canonical.store_sku_current_position` with the latest derived values.
**Alternatives.** BigQuery-side full-window recomputation daily; streaming compute on Pub/Sub; pre-aggregate materialized views.
**Why Postgres-local.** Avoids dependency on BQ for the critical path of `store_sku_current_position` updates. Incremental compute makes the per-day workload bounded (1 day of events, not 30). Latency is predictable: per-tenant compute on Cloud SQL completes in minutes; full daily cycle in 1-2 hours within retail off-hours.
**Why incremental.** Full-window recomputation against 30 days of events for 100M SKUs is expensive. With signal history preserved, yesterday's value + 1 day of new events produces today's value. Compute scales with the daily delta, not the window size.
**Bootstrap and recovery.** On day 1, or after a missed compute day, the job runs a slow path: read the full window from BigQuery and compute from scratch. Detection: missing yesterday's signal row for any SKU. Recovery: documented runbook; manual trigger.
**Output.** INSERT into `store_sku_signal_history`; UPDATE `store_sku_current_position`. Both atomic per-tenant. Audit event per SKU updated.

### D32 store_sku_signal_history as append-only canonical artifact
**Decision.** A canonical table `canonical.store_sku_signal_history` preserves daily-computed derived attributes per SKU per `as_of_date`. Append-only; never updated. Partitioned by `as_of_date`; held in Cloud SQL within the configured retention window; archived in full to BigQuery via the daily export.
**Alternatives.** Recompute on demand; store only current values on `store_sku_current_position` (without history); store in BigQuery only.
**Why.** Daily history of derived attributes has analytical value beyond today's snapshot. ROOS can backtest predictions ("velocity_7day from a week ago predicted X; today's reality is Y"). Compute jobs can read yesterday's value cheaply. Storing in Cloud SQL within the retention window keeps the daily compute Postgres-local. BigQuery archive keeps full history for long-term analytics.
**Why typed columns per signal (not JSONB).** Signals are well-defined per row; analytics over time-series read specific columns by name. JSONB would force extract-by-key on every read for no flexibility benefit. New signals are added as new columns via Alembic migration.

### D33 Event-table dedup policy: append-only with read-time latest-wins
**Decision.** Event tables (`canonical.store_sku_sale_events`, `canonical.store_sku_change_events`) are strictly append-only with no UNIQUE constraint. When the same underlying source event arrives multiple times (correction, retry), each arrival is written as a separate row in the event table. Latest-wins is applied at **read time**, not write time.

**The dedup key for "same source event":** `(tenant_id, store_id, source_id, source_event_id)`. Each source-at-a-store is its own numbering namespace. This handles:
- POS systems that number transactions per-store (each store's POS starts from 1).
- ERP systems that issue globally unique IDs (the dedup key is still correct; uniqueness is just broader than necessary).
- Multiple sources per store (POS + ERP both report sales): each source dedupes independently.

**Hot table follows event-time-wins.** The `store_sku_current_position` hot table reflects the latest correction via event-time-wins UPSERT. The hot tier answers "what is true now"; event tables answer "what did we ever hear".

**Audit emission on duplicates.** When an event-table INSERT lands on an existing dedup key, the audit emission records:
- `outcome = DUPLICATE_NOOP` if the new event's canonical payload is byte-identical to the prior latest event (typical retry from Pub/Sub redelivery or streaming-consumer reprocess).
- `outcome = DUPLICATE_OVERWRITTEN` if the new event's canonical payload differs (correction from the source).
- `prior_trace_id` records the trace_id of the prior latest event for traceability.

Ops can answer "what's the duplicate rate per tenant?" by querying audit; no DB scan over event tables needed.

**Alternatives considered.**
- **DB-level dedup with UNIQUE constraint and ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE.** Simpler queries (event table contains one row per source event). Rejected because it loses the correction history: if POS sends $100, then $95, only $95 survives in the event table. Audit alone doesn't preserve enough to reconstruct what was originally claimed.
- **Application-level dedup with explicit superseding link.** Each correction row carries `superseded_by_trace_id` pointing to the latest. Adds a write-time read and a maintenance burden (updating the link when a newer correction arrives). Rejected as over-engineering for v1.0; latest-wins via `event_ts` + `received_ts` is enough.

**Read-time mechanism.** Queries and dbt views over event tables apply:
```sql
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
  PARTITION BY tenant_id, store_id, source_id, source_event_id
  ORDER BY event_ts DESC, received_ts DESC
) = 1
```
to filter to the current truth. dbt models in BigQuery `canonical_history.*` expose a `latest_event` view over the raw events so downstream consumers don't have to rewrite the window function.

**Tradeoff acknowledged.** Slightly larger event-table storage (every correction is preserved). At v1.0 beta scale (~150K events/day, expected correction rate <1%) this is negligible (~1500 additional rows/day). Reports and dashboards over event tables must filter to latest by default; the "show me all corrections" query is the unusual one.

**Forward note.** Trace-level dedup at streaming-consumer entry (check audit for prior `CANONICAL_WRITTEN` on the same `trace_id` before reprocessing) is a future compute-saving optimisation, not correctness-critical. See `architecture.md` §9.2.

**Schema gap (see D38, RESOLVED).** The dedup key named above (`source_id`, `source_event_id`) did not map to columns in the applied canonical schema when this entry was written. D38 resolved it (Slice 10 plan mode): migration `0003_canonical_dedup_event_time` (M-D38/D64) added both columns to both event tables; the read-time window's live ORDER BY is `source_sale_timestamp`/`source_event_timestamp DESC, last_updated_at DESC, id DESC`.

### D34 Audit events to Cloud SQL `audit.events` during Phase 1; BigQuery archive deferred to Phase 3

**Decision.** Audit events are written to a Cloud SQL `audit.events` table during Phase 1. BigQuery `audit_events` remains the long-term archive (per D29's spirit) but its ingestion is deferred to Phase 3 alongside the rest of the nightly batch + BigQuery work.

**Why.**
- BigQuery streaming ingest requires a live cloud project. v1.0 launch infrastructure (Terraform, `ithina-dis-dev`, `ithina-dis-staging`, `ithina-dis-prod`) is deferred to a later trigger. Routing audit through Cloud SQL for Phase 1 lets the audit-lookup feature (dis-ui-server) ship without waiting on cloud setup.
- Cloud SQL is the same datastore everything else writes to in Phase 1, so the audit emitter doesn't need a separate transport during initial development.
- Beta-scale audit volume (10 + F events per ingress event, ~150K events/day) sits comfortably in Cloud SQL with daily partitioning.

**Architectural intent unchanged.** BigQuery `audit_events` is still the long-term home (decisions D7 and D29 hold). Phase 3 adds the Cloud SQL → BigQuery archive job for audit, alongside the canonical_history archive (build-guide.md Slice 21). After that, Cloud SQL `audit.events` becomes a short-term rolling buffer (35-day retention matching event tables).

**Implications.**
- New Postgres `audit` schema; new `audit.events` table; DDL at `schemas/postgres/audit/events.sql`. Mirrors the column shape of `schemas/bigquery/audit_events.sql`.
- `libs/dis-audit` Phase 1 writer targets Cloud SQL. Phase 3 adds the BigQuery archive path; the writer interface stays stable.
- dis-ui-server's audit lookup (build-guide Slice 13) reads from Cloud SQL.
- `libs/dis-core` BqClient is a stub during Phase 1; real implementation lands with Phase 3.

**Alternatives considered.**
- **BigQuery from day one with a real cloud project provisioned in Phase 0.** Rejected: cloud setup is deferred precisely because no slice yet needs it; advancing it just to support audit is the tail wagging the dog.
- **Cloud Logging only.** Rejected: dis-ui-server needs SQL-queryable audit for the tenant-facing audit lookup feature. Cloud Logging without a SQL home blocks Slice 13.

### D35 Mirror Sync Consumer ships in two modes; DB-pull is the v1.0 launch mode; Pub/Sub consumer is deferred

**Decision.** The `mirror-sync-consumer` service ships with two operational modes:
1. **DB-pull mode** (v1.0 launch): reads tenant and store records directly from Customer Master's Postgres database (port 5432 locally; Cloud SQL in cloud); upserts into `identity_mirror.tenants` and `identity_mirror.stores`. On-demand and schedulable.
2. **Pub/Sub consumer mode** (deferred): subscribes to `identity.changed` from Customer Master; applies upserts the same way. Activates once Customer Master emits these events.

Both modes call the same upsert logic in `sync/`. Different entry points; same write path.

**Why.**
- Customer Master does not currently emit `identity.changed`. The Pub/Sub design (D2, D11) is the architectural target, but waiting for CM's emit work would block every DIS slice that needs populated `identity_mirror` (receivers, streaming consumer, dis-ui-server).
- DB-pull works against the same Customer Master DB schema the eventual Pub/Sub events would carry. It's not a workaround for local dev only: same code runs against CM's Cloud SQL in production.
- Reconciliation use case persists. Even after Pub/Sub goes live, a periodic DB-pull serves as cheap reconciliation (catch missed events, recover from outages). DB-pull stays in v1.0; doesn't retire when Pub/Sub activates.

**Architectural intent unchanged.** D2 (Identity Service mediates Customer Master) and D11 (mirror via `identity.changed`) remain the canonical architecture. DB-pull is an *additional* mode, not a replacement.

**Implications.**
- `services/mirror-sync-consumer/` carries both modes: `pull/` subdirectory for DB-pull; `consumer/` for Pub/Sub.
- Build-guide.md Slice 7 ships DB-pull mode. Pub/Sub mode is a later slice, triggered when Customer Master emits.
- Operator runs DB-pull on-demand at first; can schedule via Cloud Scheduler or a CronJob later.
- Tests bypass this service entirely via Slice 2's fixture seeder (which writes to `identity_mirror` directly).

**Alternatives considered.**
- **Pre-seed identity_mirror with a hand-written SQL script for local; build a separate Cloud SQL sync for cloud.** Rejected: two mechanisms for the same job. The DB-pull tool serves local and cloud identically.
- **Block all dependent slices until Customer Master emits `identity.changed`.** Rejected: cross-team blocking. CM's emit work is on its own timeline; DIS development cannot pause that long.
- **Direct Postgres FK across instances.** Rejected upfront (D11): physically impossible.

### D36 CSV upload — Phase 1 is a dis-ui-server endpoint, not a separate receiver service; Phase 2 ships as `csv-ingest-worker`

**Superseded in part (D72, Slice 8).** Phase 1's signed-URL mechanic below ("returns a short-lived signed PUT URL") is superseded: the upload is now synchronous, streaming the file through dis-ui-server to GCS in one request, with no upload-session object and no signed URL. The PLACEMENT decision — Phase 1 inside dis-ui-server, the BFF rationale — stands and is what Slice 8 implemented. (Phase 2's "GCS-event-driven" trigger was separately replaced by the `csv.received` event in D54.)

**Decision.** The CSV upload flow is split into two operational halves:
1. **Phase 1 (synchronous, UI-driven).** Lives as an endpoint inside `dis-ui-server` (e.g. `POST /v1/upload-sessions`). Validates the Customer Master session, generates `trace_id`, builds the canonical GCS path via `libs/dis-storage`, returns a short-lived signed PUT URL, emits audit.
2. **Phase 2 (asynchronous, GCS-event-driven).** Lives as a standalone worker service `services/csv-ingest-worker/`. Triggered by GCS object-finalized notifications. Runs DuckDB preflight, PII tokenization, bronze metadata write, `ingress.ready` publish, audit emission, idempotency.

**Store-keying refactor recorded separately.** The composite `(tenant_id, store_id)` store-FK refactor that rode in on this decision's commit (`84b67eb`) is an independent decision; it is recorded as D39, not here.

**Why.**
- The DIS UI is the only initiator of CSV upload Phase 1. Having a separate `receiver-csv-upload` service for this means the browser talks to two backends (dis-ui-server for everything else + receiver for upload start). That defeats the purpose of having a BFF (D26).
- Phase 1 is small: auth + trace_id + signed-URL issuance. It doesn't merit a separate deployable; folding it into dis-ui-server as an endpoint is the right size.
- Phase 2 is genuinely different: long-running, large payloads, event-triggered, retries on failure, scales with data volume rather than UI concurrency. It belongs on its own scaling path as a worker, not a request-receiving service. Renaming it `csv-ingest-worker` reflects its actual nature (queue consumer, not HTTP receiver).

**Scope of this decision.**
- Applies only to CSV-upload because the UI itself is the data source.
- Other receivers stay as their own services: API/webhook, ERP CSV POST, reverse-API pull. None of these are UI-initiated; each has its own auth profile, trigger, and scaling shape.

**Implications.**
- `services/receiver-csv-upload/` is renamed to `services/csv-ingest-worker/`; its scope shrinks to Phase 2 only.
- `services/dis-ui-server/` gains an `upload_session` handler (a new sub-module). Build-guide Slice 8 lands the handler in dis-ui-server, not in a receiver service.
- The frontend talks to one backend (dis-ui-server) for all UI flows including starting a CSV upload.
- Identity Service `resolve_from_upload(upload_id)` is still used; called by the `csv-ingest-worker` in Phase 2 when the GCS notification fires (the upload session ID is encoded in the GCS object path).

**Alternatives considered.**
- **Keep `receiver-csv-upload` as a separate service for Phase 1.** Rejected: forces the UI to know two backend URLs and duplicates Customer Master auth integration. The "per-channel receiver" pattern is correct when the channel has its own auth and trigger profile; CSV-upload-from-UI is just dis-ui-server's data-ingest counterpart, not a separate channel.
- **Merge Phase 2 into dis-ui-server as well.** Rejected: Phase 2 is async, event-triggered, and CPU-heavy (DuckDB preflight on multi-MB CSVs). Coupling its scaling and process model to a UI BFF is wrong.

### D37 External identity IDs vs internal UUID keys: translation location `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (during the Slice 9a identity-correction work). Resolution: **candidate 3**, the Identity Service owns the translation. Every `resolve_*` method returns the **internal UUID** for `tenant_id`/`store_id` (and carries the authoritative external codes alongside, per D55). The single point of external-to-internal translation is the Identity Service, consumed once by dis-ui-server at CSV-upload Phase 1; from there the internal UUID propagates on `csv.received` (D54) and `ingress.ready`, so no downstream DIS consumer resolves identity from an external identifier. The invented `t_*`/`s_*` identity form is removed from the DIS Pub/Sub contracts (D52). Candidate 2 (a reversible encoding) is rejected on sizing: a ~62-bit external string cannot encode a 128-bit UUID. Candidate 1 (an `external_id` column the worker looks up) is not needed for translation, since the Identity Service returns the UUID directly; the mirror still gains the authoritative external codes for readability (D55), not as a translation bridge.

Original `OPEN` text retained below for the record. The deadline noted then (the first receiver or consumer that must resolve identity from an external identifier) was reached at CSV-upload Phase 2 design; it is settled here rather than at the worker, because the translation was lifted to Phase 1 / the Identity Service.

**Status (original, OPEN).** This entry records an open decision; it does **not** resolve it. Raised during Slice 2 (see the Slice 2 plan §2 / R1). **Deadline re-pointed (Slice 7):** the original "before Slice 7" deadline assumed Slice 7 needed the external↔internal translation. It does not — Mirror Sync (DB-pull) replicates Customer Master's own UUID-keyed columns and needs no external-id resolution for FK integrity (the mirror's keys are the UUIDs; CM's external ids, `display_code`/`store_code`, are not replicated and not required). **New hard deadline: the first receiver or consumer that must resolve identity from an external identifier.** D37 stays OPEN; it is not Slice 7's to settle.

**The gap.** The frozen identity-service OpenAPI and the `identity.changed` Pub/Sub schema expose tenants and stores as external string identifiers — `^t_[a-z0-9]{12}$` / `^s_[a-z0-9]{12}$`. The DIS schema (Slice 1) keys `identity_mirror.tenants`, `identity_mirror.stores`, and all `canonical.*` / `config.source_mappings.tenant_id` by 128-bit `UUID` (UUIDv7, "mirrors `platform_db.core.*.id`"). A 12-char base36 string (~62 bits) cannot encode a 128-bit UUID, so these are two distinct identifier spaces. No column, encoding, or layer maps one to the other anywhere in the schema, the contracts, or this register (D1–D36).

**Interim (Slice 2, not the resolution).** Slice 2's test fixture set (`dis_testing.fixtures`) pins a deterministic external↔UUID pairing as a **test-only bridge**, so tests can resolve identity (external ids) and then read the seeded UUID-keyed rows. This bridge is test infrastructure; it is explicitly **not** the production mechanism and must not become it.

**Candidate resolutions (no choice made here).**
1. Add an `external_id` column (`t_*` / `s_*`) to `identity_mirror.tenants` / `identity_mirror.stores`, indexed, populated by the mirror sync.
2. Define a deterministic, reversible encoding between the internal UUID and the external `t_*` / `s_*` form.
3. A translation layer (identity-service and/or mirror-sync owns the external↔internal map).

**Why it must be settled by Slice 7.** Slice 7 (Mirror Sync, DB-pull) writes *real* Customer Master records into the UUID-keyed `identity_mirror`. Real records carry both representations and there is no fixture bridge in production — Slice 7 needs the actual translation to land rows whose external ids match what receivers and the streaming consumer resolve. The fixture bridge cannot carry Slice 7.

### D38 Event-table dedup key names columns absent from the applied schema — `RESOLVED` (Slice 10 plan mode; migration 0003)

**Status.** `RESOLVED`. Surfaced during Slice 3 (dis-canonical models, by live-schema introspection of `ithina_dis_db`); resolved in Slice 10 plan mode as candidate resolution 1 (migration), landed by `alembic/versions/0003_canonical_dedup_event_time.py` (the M-D38/D64 prerequisite gate) before any Slice 10 service code. The original gap record is preserved below; the resolution follows it.

**The gap.** D33 and CLAUDE.md hard rule 7 define the event-table "same source event" dedup key, applied latest-wins at read time, as `(tenant_id, store_id, source_id, source_event_id)`. Introspection of the applied canonical schema shows **neither `source_id` nor `source_event_id` exists** on `canonical.store_sku_sale_events` or `canonical.store_sku_change_events` (nor on any canonical table). The only source-related columns present are `source_sale_timestamp` / `source_event_timestamp` (timestamps, not ids), `transaction_id` and `line_item_seq` (sale events only), and `related_sale_event_id`. The event tables carry no UNIQUE constraint (correctly, per D33's append-only posture), so nothing in the schema pins the key either. As written, the D33 / rule-7 `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY tenant_id, store_id, source_id, source_event_id ...)` window cannot be computed from existing columns.

**Not a dis-canonical defect.** The Slice 3 models mirror the applied schema exactly (verified by an independent column-set reconciliation, both directions, all four tables). The divergence is between the decision text and the migration that was applied (Slice 1), not in the Python models.

**Candidate resolutions (no choice made here).**
1. Add `source_id` and `source_event_id` columns to both event tables via an Alembic migration, populated by the streaming consumer from the mapping; the dedup key then maps literally.
2. Redefine the dedup key against columns that already exist (e.g. a per-source `transaction_id` plus a source discriminator), and amend D33 / rule 7 to match.
3. Carry the source identifiers inside `ingest_metadata` (jsonb) and compute the key from there (weaker — not indexable, not a first-class column).

**Why it must be settled by Slice 10.** Slice 10 builds the streaming consumer's atomic dual-write and the read-time latest-wins semantics depend on this key. Either the columns must exist (option 1) or the key must be redefined (option 2) before that code is written; otherwise the consumer cannot implement D33 as specified. Do not edit the DDL or the rule wording under Slice 3 — this entry only registers the gap. Cross-referenced from D33.

**Resolution (Slice 10 plan mode, M-D38/D64).** Resolution 1, migration required. Option-2 stand-ins fail on the live schema: `transaction_id`/`line_item_seq` exist only on sale events and are nullable; change events carry no source event identifier at all; `dis_channel` is the ingress channel, not the source registration id (multiple sources share a channel, so it cannot partition D33's per-source numbering namespaces). Option 3 (`ingest_metadata` JSONB) rejected: a correctness-bearing key in untyped, unindexable JSONB (the same reasoning as D64). Migration `0003_canonical_dedup_event_time` added to BOTH event tables `source_id VARCHAR(128) COLLATE "C" NOT NULL` (type/length/collation matched to `config.source_mappings.source_id` and `bronze.data_ingress_events.source_id`, introspected) and `source_event_id VARCHAR(256) COLLATE "C" NOT NULL`, plus the window-supporting indexes `ix_ssse_dedup_key`/`ix_ssce_dedup_key` `(tenant_id, store_id, source_id, source_event_id, source_{sale|event}_timestamp DESC)`, and D64's `last_source_event_at` on the hot table. The NOT NULL adds were legal against introspected-empty event tables; the migration re-checks `COUNT(*) = 0` immediately before each add and aborts otherwise. The D33 window's live column mapping: `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY tenant_id, store_id, source_id, source_event_id ORDER BY source_{sale|event}_timestamp DESC, last_updated_at DESC, id DESC) = 1` (`event_ts`/`received_ts` in D33's prose map to the source timestamp and `last_updated_at`; `id` is uuidv7, the deterministic final tie-break). Population (consumer-side, Slice 10): `source_id` from the `ingress.ready` envelope (cross-checked against the GCS path and bronze row); `source_event_id` = `transaction_id || ':' || line_item_seq` when the source supplies them, else the deterministic fallback `bronze_ref || ':' || chunk_row_index` — redelivery-stable but NOT correction-collapsing for id-less sources (registered as D65, Slice 10). **Cross-refs.** D33, D64, D65, Slice 10.

---

### D39 Canonical store keying: composite `(tenant_id, store_id)` FK with global `store_id` uniqueness

**Status.** Settled; in force in the applied schema. The refactor landed under the D36 commit (`84b67eb`) but is an independent decision (it only shared that commit), so it is recorded here with its own number rather than as a note under D36. Surfaced/registered during Slice 3 while introspecting the live `ithina_dis_db` schema for the dis-canonical models.

**Decision.** Canonical tables key a store by the composite `(tenant_id, store_id)`, not by `store_id` alone. In the applied schema:
- `identity_mirror.stores` has PRIMARY KEY `(tenant_id, store_id)` plus a global `UNIQUE (store_id)` (`uq_ims_store_id`); `identity_mirror.tenants` has PRIMARY KEY `(tenant_id)`.
- Every canonical table (`store_sku_current_position`, `store_sku_sale_events`, `store_sku_change_events`, `store_sku_signal_history`) carries both a tenant FK `(tenant_id) -> identity_mirror.tenants(tenant_id)` and a composite store FK `(tenant_id, store_id) -> identity_mirror.stores(tenant_id, store_id)`.

**Why composite.** Tenant isolation becomes structural: a store FK on `store_id` alone would let a canonical row reference a store without re-asserting its tenant, leaving room at the referential layer for a store to be tied to the wrong tenant. Keying the FK on `(tenant_id, store_id)` makes "this store belongs to this tenant" an engine-enforced invariant on every canonical write, complementing RLS (D12). The global `UNIQUE (store_id)` keeps `store_id` a stable standalone identifier for lookups and the mirror sync, so the composite FK adds tenant-scoping without giving up global uniqueness.

**Evidence (introspected, `ithina_dis_db`).** `pk_ims = PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, store_id)`; `uq_ims_store_id = UNIQUE (store_id)`; canonical `fk_*_store = FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id, store_id) REFERENCES identity_mirror.stores(tenant_id, store_id)`.

**Scope.** Docs only; records a decision already in force. No schema or DDL change. Relates to D12 (mirror table plus real FK as the cross-DB integrity substitute); cross-referenced from D36.

### D40 PII handling posture: deferral, fail-loud gate, and one-way-vs-reversible `OPEN`

**Status.** The Slice 4 fail-loud gate is **settled and in force**; the long-term tokenization posture is **`OPEN`**. Surfaced/registered during Slice 4 (`dis-pii`). **Hard deadline for the posture: the first PII-carrying receiver — a non-CSV receiver, or a CSV source mapping that flags a PII column.**

**The gap (three sources disagree).**
- **D24** specifies one-way deterministic **HMAC** with per-tenant keys; right-to-erasure is a key-vault delete. Reads as irreversible.
- **`build-guide.md:102`** defers a "storage backend for the **token → ciphertext** mapping" — i.e. a *reversible* (recoverable) mapping.
- **CLAUDE.md hard rule 2** names "deterministic HMAC with per-tenant **KMS** keys."
These are not consistent on whether tokenization is one-way (HMAC, no recovery) or reversible (token↔ciphertext), nor on what "configured backend" ultimately means. Not settled here.

**What Slice 4 built (settled, in force).** `dis-pii` provides heuristic PII detection (field-name / pattern) and a fail-loud gate: a mapping flagging any PII column with **no configured backend** raises `PiiBackendNotConfiguredError` *before* any persistence (hard rule 2, code-quality rule 4). No real backend exists in v1.0, so the gate raises on every flagged PII column. The not-raise branch is reachable **only** via an explicitly injected backend (tests); no config default or flag disables the gate. The tokenizer, key vault, and tokenization policy are inert placeholder seams (no crypto, no I/O), mirroring the Slice 3 `BqClient` discipline.

**Known limitations (registered, not fixed).**
1. **Heuristic detection → false negatives.** Detection matches column *names* against a PII set (phone, email, loyalty_id, PAN, Aadhaar; D24) and patterns. A PII column whose name the matcher does not recognise is **not** detected, so the gate does not fire on it. "Fail loud on PII" is bounded by detection coverage; it is not a guarantee that all PII is caught.
2. **No explicit per-column PII flag exists.** Live introspection (Slice 4) shows no PII-flag column on `config.source_mappings`, and the `mapping_rules` shape is `{version, rename, normalize, cast, derive}` — nothing for detection to read as an authoritative flag. An explicit-flag mechanism would require a **new `mapping_rules` field** (and likely a `config.source_mappings` change): a future schema + contract change, not built here.

**Doc-correction note (register, do not fix).** `architecture.md:99` reads "See `decisions.md` D18 for the PII module," but D18 is the validation split; the intended reference is **D24**. (`architecture.md` lines 305 and 432 already cite D24 correctly.) Correct the line 99 citation when the PII posture is next touched.

**Candidate resolutions (no choice made here).**
1. **One-way HMAC only** (no recovery): "configured backend" = the per-tenant key vault; erasure = key delete (D24 as written).
2. **Reversible token↔ciphertext store**: "configured backend" = that store; supports recovery but widens the erasure surface (build-guide framing).

**Why it must be settled then.** The first PII-carrying receiver needs a real backend — until one exists, the gate raises. **Scope.** Docs + the Slice 4 `dis-pii` lib. No DDL change. Cross-referenced from D24.

### D41 `identity_mirror` RLS posture: build-guide vs applied schema `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (Slice 7, by fresh live introspection of `ithina_dis_db`). Originally surfaced during Slice 4 (`dis-rls`). **Resolution: RLS-off on `identity_mirror` is correct.** The mirror holds identity that every tenant's canonical rows FK against and that ops/streaming read across tenants; RLS there would add no isolation that matters and would complicate the cross-tenant Mirror Sync write. So the Mirror Sync upsert is a plain write as the DIS service role — no per-row tenant scoping, no distinct role (it still flows through `dis-rls` `rls_session` solely to inherit the `current_database()` target guard; the per-row `app.tenant_id` is a harmless no-op under RLS-off). The stale side is `build-guide.md:108` ("`identity_mirror` is RLS-protected", with its per-row-vs-distinct-role plan-mode question); correcting that text is an operator call at the commit gate (register-only here).

**The gap.** `build-guide.md:108` (Slice 7) states "`identity_mirror` is RLS-protected" and asks plan-mode to choose between setting `app.tenant_id` per-row on upsert vs running Mirror Sync under a distinct role. But live introspection shows `identity_mirror.tenants` and `identity_mirror.stores` have **`relrowsecurity = false` and no policy** — consistent with the Slice 1/2 findings and the seeder's own comment that it writes to RLS-not-enabled schemas. So either the schema must gain RLS (a migration) or the build-guide text must drop the "RLS-protected" claim.

**Evidence (introspected, `ithina_dis_db`).** `pg_class.relrowsecurity = f` and `relforcerowsecurity = f` for `identity_mirror.tenants` and `identity_mirror.stores`; `pg_policies` has no rows for schema `identity_mirror`. (Contrast: `bronze.data_ingress_events` and `canonical.*` are `relrowsecurity = t, relforcerowsecurity = t` with a `tenant_isolation` policy.)

**Why Slice 7.** Mirror Sync writes real tenants/stores into `identity_mirror`; its upsert path and role posture depend on whether RLS is in force there. Resolve before that code is written. Do not edit the DDL or the build-guide under Slice 4 — this entry only registers the contradiction. **Scope.** Docs only. Relates to hard rule 1 / D12.

### D42 Audit `audit.events` drift: D33/D14/§8 duplicate-audit fields are absent from the live schema `OPEN`

**Status.** `OPEN`. Records a doc-vs-schema drift surfaced during Slice 6 (`dis-audit`) by live introspection of `ithina_dis_db`; it does **not** resolve it (no DDL edited). The D38-analog for the audit table. **Resolution owner: Slice 10** (streaming consumer, which emits duplicate-audit detail per D33).

**The gap.** D33 / `architecture.md` §2.3.3 specify, on a duplicate event-table INSERT, `outcome = DUPLICATE_NOOP` or `DUPLICATE_OVERWRITTEN` and a `prior_trace_id`. `architecture.md:702` lists the per-row audit field set as `{trace_id, tenant_id, store_id, source_id, stage, status, ts, row_hash, error_code, error_detail}`. The **live `audit.events` cannot represent these**:
- `ck_audit_events_outcome_vocab` permits only `SUCCESS, FAILURE, SKIPPED, RETRIED` — `DUPLICATE_NOOP`/`DUPLICATE_OVERWRITTEN` would violate the CHECK.
- There is **no** `prior_trace_id`, `store_id`, `source_id`, `source_event_id`, or `row_hash` column.

**Evidence (introspected, `ithina_dis_db`).** `pg_get_constraintdef(ck_audit_events_outcome_vocab)` = `CHECK ((outcome)::text = ANY (ARRAY['SUCCESS','FAILURE','SKIPPED','RETRIED']))`. `information_schema.columns` for `audit.events` returns 23 columns; a filter for `store_id`/`source_id`/`source_event_id`/`row_hash` returns 0 rows. The only structured-context column is `event_data JSONB` (its `COMMENT` documents stage-specific shapes).

**Intended home (not closed by DDL here).** The duplicate-audit detail (`DUPLICATE_*` distinction, `prior_trace_id`, the dedup key `store_id`/`source_id`/`source_event_id`, `row_hash`) lands in the `event_data` JSONB, not first-class columns — unless Slice 10 elects a DDL change (extend the CHECK / add columns). `dis-audit` therefore does **not** define `DUPLICATE_*` outcomes or those columns; its `Outcome`/`EventScope` enums mirror the live CHECKs exactly. Cross-referenced from D33 and D38. **Scope.** Docs only; no DDL edited under Slice 6.

**Drift-guard limit (Slice 6 AC2).** The `dis-audit` model reconciliation against the live schema is a column-**name set** match only (both directions), not a per-column type / nullability / FK check. So a *type narrowing* on an existing column (e.g. `varchar(64)` → `varchar(32)`, or widening an int) passes the set match and is caught only as a runtime INSERT failure — which fire-and-forget then swallows (a D45 silent-loss-family case). Recorded, not fixed; no test or DDL change here. To be addressed when audit schema-vs-contract drift is next touched (Slice 10), alongside the duplicate-audit detail above.

### D43 Every DIS audit event carries a known `tenant_id`; no tenant-less audit path `SETTLED`

**Status.** `SETTLED` (product boundary). Parallels D41 in shape (a schema looser than the rule) but is **settled, not OPEN**: the operator has ruled this a permanent product boundary, not a v1.0 convenience.

**Decision.** Every DIS audit event carries a known `tenant_id`. DIS has no tenant-less audit path. The `dis-audit` writer goes through `dis_rls.rls_session(engine, tenant_id)` (hard rule 12); an event with no `tenant_id` is refused loudly (`AuditWriteError`, logged), never silently dropped.

**Why (product facts).** Uploads are always for a known tenant and one of its stores — the tenant comes from the authenticated Customer Master session; the store is supplied or read from the CSV. Downstream pipeline stages inherit that tenant. Authentication is Customer Master's responsibility (D25), so DIS does not record auth events and a failed sign-in is never a DIS audit event. Scheduled jobs (Slice 18, daily-compute) and ops actions (Slice 12, replay) act per-tenant.

**Schema-vs-product gap (recorded, not closed by DDL).** The live `rls_audit_events_tenant` policy permits `tenant_id IS NULL` and the column is nullable, so the schema is **looser** than the product rule. The product rule wins. The NULL branch is left as intentional headroom, not a supported path. Making `tenant_id NOT NULL` to match the rule is a separate DDL slice, not undertaken here; its absence is a tolerated, recorded mismatch — **not debt the next slice must clear**.

**Evidence (introspected, `ithina_dis_db`).** `audit.events.tenant_id` `is_nullable = YES`; policy `rls_audit_events_tenant` `USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id', true)::uuid OR tenant_id IS NULL)`; `relrowsecurity = t, relforcerowsecurity = t`. `fk_audit_events_tenant → identity_mirror.tenants(tenant_id)`.

**Supporting evidence — non-deferred Phase-1 emitters all emit post-identity.** dis-ui-server `upload_session` (Slice 8, after session validate); csv-ingest-worker (Slice 9, identity inherited from the upload session); streaming-consumer (Slice 10, `tenant_id` carried on `ingress.ready`); quarantine-drainer (Slice 11, rows carry `tenant_id`); daily-compute (Slice 18, `app.tenant_id` per tenant). The `events.sql:83` "pre-auth receiver errors" comment refers to **receiver services, all DEFERRED**; whether a deferred receiver ever emits a tenant-less event is a decision owned by that future receiver slice — not a v1.0 deferral and not this decision's trigger.

**What Slice 6 builds.** The writer requires a non-NULL `tenant_id` (`rls_session` posture); the `AuditEvent` model mirrors the nullable column for the both-directions drift guard, but the writer enforces the product rule, so a `None` raises `AuditWriteError` (logged, never a silent drop). **Scope.** `dis-audit` writer + this register entry; no DDL edited.

### D44 Phase-1 audit-write idempotency: tolerate duplicates in Cloud SQL

**Decision.** Phase-1 audit writes to Cloud SQL `audit.events` **tolerate duplicate rows**. The writer adds no dedup key and no `ON CONFLICT`; each emit is a new `uuidv7()`-keyed row.

**Why.** The live `audit.events` has no UNIQUE key beyond `pk_audit_events (id, event_date)` on the synthetic `id` — no natural key on `(trace_id, stage)`. This matches the documented audit posture: `architecture.md` §2.3.3 and the BigQuery `audit_events` caveats (3, 4) state audit accepts retry/replay duplicates and dedups at query time. Pub/Sub redelivery and the `DUPLICATE_NOOP` reprocess path can re-emit the same `(trace_id, stage)`; that is accepted, not prevented.

**Divergence registered.** `architecture.md:657` describes audit as "At-least-once; idempotent in BQ via `insertId`." Cloud SQL has no `insertId` analog, so Phase-1 has weaker (no transport-level) idempotency than the Phase-3 BigQuery target. Acceptable at beta scale; the read-time/query-time dedup stance is unchanged. **Evidence (introspected).** `pg_constraint` for `audit.events` shows one `p` constraint `pk_audit_events (id, event_date)` and no `u` constraint. **Scope.** `dis-audit` writer; no DDL edited.

### D45 Audit partition coverage is finite and has no DEFAULT partition — out-of-range writes are silently lost `RESOLVED-for-beta`

**Status.** `RESOLVED-for-beta` (Slice 30a, D77). The silent write-cliff is closed by removal: `audit.events` is de-partitioned to a plain table (migration 0007; fresh bootstrap reconciled), so no `event_date` can miss a partition. The production retention policy — BQ archive + eviction + re-partition-WITH-automation — remains Slice 21's deliverable (D29/D34); this entry's gap analysis is preserved below as registered.

**Original registration (Slice 6, preserved per the revision lifecycle):** `OPEN` (operational gap). Surfaced during Slice 6 by live introspection; registered, not closed (partition automation is a separate operational concern, not a Slice 6 deliverable).

**The gap.** `audit.events` is `PARTITION BY RANGE (event_date)` with daily partitions **only `2026-06-01` … `2026-06-07`** and **no DEFAULT partition**. No partition-creation job exists yet (the DDL notes subsequent partitions are created by a Cloud Scheduler job or a daily-compute side task — `schemas/postgres/audit/events.sql:177-180`). A write whose `event_date` falls outside the covered range raises *"no partition of relation events found for row"*; under fire-and-forget (hard rule 11) that is then swallowed, so the audit row vanishes. With coverage ending `2026-06-07`, this produces **silent audit loss within days** of the current date (`2026-06-03`). This is grant-independent.

**Not the grant.** `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA audit … TO ithina_dis_user` **is** in force (`pg_default_acl`: `audit | r | granted_by ithina_dis_admin | ithina_dis_user=arwd`, `a` = INSERT), matching `build-guide.md:89`, so admin-created future partitions auto-inherit INSERT. The risk is the **absence of the partitions themselves**, not a missing grant.

**Mitigation in `dis-audit`.** The writer logs a swallowed write failure as an error explicitly flagged as worth alerting (a missing partition / missing grant / schema mismatch is "not absorbed as routine"). It does **not** create partitions. **Resolution owner.** A partition-management operational task (Cloud Scheduler / daily-compute side task) before audit traffic reaches an uncovered date. **Scope.** Docs + a writer log line; no DDL edited.

### D46 `identity_mirror` soft-delete is via `status`, not an `is_active` column `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (Slice 7). A doc-vs-schema gap: `services/mirror-sync-consumer/CLAUDE.md`, its `README.md`, and `architecture.md` §4.3 describe Mirror Sync soft-deleting via an `is_active` column. **No such column exists** on either mirror table.

**Evidence (introspected, `ithina_dis_db`).** `identity_mirror.tenants` columns: `tenant_id, name, status, pc_created_at, pc_updated_at, pc_suspended_at, pc_terminated_at, mirror_synced_at`. `identity_mirror.stores` columns: `store_id, tenant_id, name, status, country, timezone, currency, tax_treatment, pc_created_at, pc_updated_at, pc_closed_at, mirror_synced_at`. A query for an `is_active` column in schema `identity_mirror` returns no rows. Lifecycle lives in `status` (tenants: `…/SUSPENDED/TERMINATED`; stores: `…/INACTIVE/CLOSED`) with the per-lifecycle `pc_*` timestamps alongside.

**Resolution.** Lifecycle is Customer Master's `status` replicated verbatim; the sync is **upsert-only — never delete, never soft-delete**, which is what Slice 7 implements. The service `CLAUDE.md` is corrected here; correcting the `README.md` / `architecture.md` `is_active` language is an operator call at the commit gate. **Scope.** Docs only; no DDL. Relates to D12, D39, D41.

---

### D47 DIS keeps every mirrored row; Customer-Master-side deletion handling is deferred `OPEN`

**Status.** `OPEN` (deferred, registered by Slice 7). Mirror Sync (DB-pull) is upsert-only and **does not delete or mark-absent** a mirror row when its Customer Master source is hard-deleted or removed. Deleting a mirror row would orphan or cascade against the canonical / audit / config rows that FK to it (D12, D39; the mirror store FK is `ON DELETE RESTRICT`).

**The gap & symmetry.** A CM row removed at source leaves a stale mirror row. Resolving this needs both a CM-side delete/deactivation path **and** a data-governance policy for the referential cleanup. Note the symmetry: the same orphan-vs-cascade risk lands inside Customer Master itself (its own children reference the row), so a policy that solves it on one side without the other reintroduces the risk. **Trigger:** Customer Master implements a delete/deactivation path AND a governance policy defines the cleanup. **Scope.** Docs only.

---

### D48 A Customer-Master-shaped test Postgres harness exists and is reusable `SETTLED`

**Status.** `SETTLED` (Slice 7). DB-pull reads Customer Master's *Postgres*, but the Slice 2 Customer Master fake is **HTTP-only** (JWTs / sessions / events) and the real CM (port 5432) is off-limits to tests. Slice 7 therefore built a faithful stand-in: `dis_testing.customer_master_db` provisions an in-cluster `ithina_platform_db` database on 5433 with `core.tenants` / `core.stores`, **FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY** + the platform-access policy, seeded from `dis_testing.fixtures`, with `SELECT` granted to the NOBYPASSRLS service role (so the no-context-→-zero-rows behavior is exercised for real). The reader asserts `current_database()` is the CM database; the writer is `ithina_dis_db` — both on 5433, the real CM never touched.

**Reuse, not rebuild.** A later CM-reading slice (e.g. the Pub/Sub consumer mode, or any service that reads CM) **reuses this harness** rather than rebuilding it. **Correction registered:** the Slice 7 doc's "Slice 2 Customer Master fake" dependency and criterion 8 wording were inaccurate for a DB-pull read (the fake cannot serve a DB read); the slice doc has been edited to name the test-CM Postgres harness so the doc and the build agree. **Scope.** Test infrastructure + docs; no production DDL.

---

### D49 `mapping_rules` drives normalization via a field named `normalize`; the `transforms` wording in D20/architecture.md is stale `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (Slice 5, by live introspection of `ithina_dis_db`). Records a confirmed doc-vs-schema naming divergence; the engine follows the live schema.

**The divergence.** D20 and `architecture.md` (§6.1 step 6, the ASCII config box, and the Glossary's "Normalization" entry) describe normalization as driven by a declarative **`transforms`** field in the mapping config. The live `config.source_mappings.mapping_rules` JSONB uses **`normalize`**: the seeded row (`mapping_version_id=1`) carries `{"version":1,"rename":{},"normalize":{},"cast":{},"derive":{}}`, and the live column comment reads "The rename + normalize + cast + derive rules per source field. JSONB; shape is source-type dependent; documented in libs/dis-mapping; validated by Pandera when the streaming consumer loads it." D40's note had already recorded the `normalize` shape; Slice 5 re-introspected and confirmed it.

**Resolution.** The field is **`normalize`**. `libs/dis-mapping`'s `SourceMapping` model reads `{version, rename, normalize, cast, derive}` and is the documented contract for the inner shape (the live row's sub-objects are empty, so live data does not constrain it; the column comment delegates the documentation to libs/dis-mapping). **Inner shape (Slice 5):** `normalize` and `derive` are `dict[canonical_col, ORDERED LIST of {op, args}]`, applied in declared sequence; ops are atomic and single-purpose; `cast` is `dict[canonical_col, {type, precision?, scale?}]`. Separator/locale args (`parse_decimal`, `parse_integer`) are mandatory declarations — never defaulted or inferred (the locale rule has no other doc home; it is pinned in the lib contract). Correcting the `transforms` wording in `architecture.md`/D20 prose is an operator call at the commit gate (register-only here). **Scope.** Docs + the Slice 5 `dis-mapping` model; no DDL.

### D50 pandera 0.31.1 polars engine crashes on Decimal-schema vs non-Decimal data; contained pre-check workaround in dis-validation `OPEN`

**Status.** `OPEN` (upstream bug; contained workaround in force). Surfaced during Slice 5 implementation — the plan-mode probes validated Decimal-vs-Decimal but not Decimal-vs-other-dtype. **Owner: Slice 5. Removal trigger: the canary test goes red.**

**The bug.** pandera 0.31.1 (the pinned, newest release — no patched 0.31.x exists) raises a raw `AssertionError` ("The return is expected to be of Decimal class", `pandera/engines/polars_engine.py`) when a schema column declaring `pl.Decimal(p,s)` validates data of ANY non-Decimal dtype (String and Float64 both reproduce). Every other dtype mismatch reports a typed `dtype(...)` failure case; Decimal-vs-Decimal precision/scale mismatches also report natively. Unhandled, a contribution with a wrong-typed Decimal column (e.g. a mapping missing its cast rule) would crash the canonical-shape gate with a non-`DisError` instead of routing a typed failure — a consumer crash-loop path, not a quarantine path.

**The contained workaround** (`dis_validation.runner._decimal_dtype_precheck`). Scoped STRICTLY to Decimal-schema columns: before pandera runs, columns whose schema dtype is `pl.Decimal` and whose data dtype is not Decimal get the SAME failure-case row a native dtype check produces (same `check` string, same column-level grain), formatted by the same formatter — downstream sees one shape for one logical error (asserted by `test_decimal_dtype_mismatch_failure_is_indistinguishable_from_native`). The affected column alone is neutralized for the pandera run; every other column stays entirely pandera's. No `AssertionError` is caught anywhere.

**The canary** (`libs/dis-validation/tests/unit/test_pandera_decimal_canary.py`) feeds pandera the broken case directly (outside the workaround) and asserts the raw `AssertionError` STILL occurs, plus asserts the bug's boundary (Decimal-vs-Decimal reports natively). Any upstream behaviour change — within or beyond the version pin — turns the canary red, forcing the workaround's removal review. Do not loosen the canary; remove the workaround. **Scope.** `dis-validation` runner + tests; no DDL.

### D51 Tier-0 structural CSV validation lives in dis-ui-server's upload endpoint, not the frontend and not the pure pipeline libs `OPEN`

**Status.** `OPEN`, forward-looking (registered at the Slice 5 commit gate; operator-directed).

Tier-0 structural CSV validation (file present, non-empty, decodes, parses as CSV, min-rows floor) lives in dis-ui-server as a module within the upload endpoint, not in the frontend and not in the pure pipeline libs (dis-mapping/dis-validation operate on parsed frames, never bytes); it is structural-only, with column/mapping-aware checks remaining tier 1 (the source-shape suite). **Owner:** the slice building dis-ui-server's upload endpoint. **Promotion trigger:** promote to a shared lib only if a second upload entry path needs the same gate. **Naming note:** `dis-ui-server` is the live architecture's name for the BFF (D26, D36; build-guide Slice 8) — no divergence. **Cross-refs:** D4, D18, slice-05.

---

### D52 DIS Pub/Sub contracts: identity is the internal UUID; the invented `t_*`/`s_*` form is removed; external codes ride along, optional but producer-required `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (Slice 9a). Corrects a contract-vs-authority defect found while planning CSV ingest: every DIS Pub/Sub envelope keyed `tenant_id`/`store_id` to the pattern `^t_[a-z0-9]{12}$` / `^s_[a-z0-9]{12}$`, a form that matches neither the authoritative internal UUID (Customer Master `core.*.id`, mirrored verbatim) nor the authoritative external code (`display_code`/`store_code`). It was a DIS-invented identifier for entities DIS does not own.

**Decision.** Across all DIS Pub/Sub contracts, the identity fields carry the **internal UUID** (`format: uuid`), load-bearing. The `t_*`/`s_*` form is removed. Where a readable code is wanted on the wire, contracts carry the authoritative Customer Master codes as separate fields, `tenant_display_code` (= `tenants.display_code`) and `store_code` (= `stores.store_code`): **optional in the schema, but producers MUST populate them when publishing** (enforced producer-side and in producer tests, not by the validator). Codes are readability only, never a substitute for the UUID.

**Files corrected (edited in place; `schema_version` stays `const: 1`).** All live in `contracts/pubsub/`: `ingress.ready`, `ingress.resubmit`, `quarantine`, `pipeline.dlq`, `mapping.changed`, `identity.changed`, plus the new `csv.received` (D54). Each schema and its example updated. Because the change is breaking but **nothing consumes these in production** (local dev only, no staging), the version is not bumped; the schemas are treated as never-deployed drafts.

**Per-contract specifics.**
- `ingress.ready` / `ingress.resubmit`: `tenant_id`, `store_id` to UUID; add the two code fields; `gcs_uri` tenant segment to UUID (D53).
- `quarantine`: same, `store_id` stays optional; `gcs_uri` to UUID (D53).
- `pipeline.dlq`: `tenant_id` to UUID; add `tenant_display_code`; `batch.rows_ref` is unpatterned, example path updated to the UUID segment.
- `mapping.changed`: `tenant_id` to UUID; add `tenant_display_code`. `changed_by` is a user-id vocabulary (`u_*`), out of scope.
- `identity.changed`: `entity_id` and `tenant_id` to UUID; `payload.is_active` (boolean) replaced by `payload.status` (string) to match D46; `payload` gains `display_code`/`store_code` so Mirror Sync's Pub/Sub mode can populate the new mirror columns (D55).

**Cross-refs.** D37 (translation resolved; this removes the invented form it described), D53 (GCS path UUID), D54 (`csv.received`), D55 (mirror external-code columns), D46 (`status` not `is_active`). **Scope.** Contracts + examples only; the Identity Service and producer code that must populate UUID + codes are D37 / D55 and the relevant slices.

---

### D53 GCS object-path tenant segment is the internal tenant UUID, not an external code `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (Slice 9a). Settles the path-form half of the identity correction (D52): the canonical GCS object path embedded a `t_*` tenant segment (`tenant/t_[a-z0-9]{12}/...`), the same invented external form, pinned both in hard rule 9 and in the `gcs_uri` regex of the frozen Pub/Sub contracts.

**Decision.** The tenant segment of the canonical GCS object path is the **internal tenant UUID**. Path scheme: `tenant/{tenant_uuid}/source/{source_id}/yyyy=Y/mm=M/dd=D/{trace_id}.{ext}`. Chosen over the external `display_code` because the UUID is immutable and authoritative, whereas `display_code` is user-editable in Customer Master: keying object paths (and the dedup and lineage that read them) on a mutable code would break path stability on a tenant rename. The `gcs_uri` regex in every contract that carries it (`ingress.ready`, `ingress.resubmit`, `quarantine`) changes its tenant segment from `t_[a-z0-9]{12}` to the UUID form; `pipeline.dlq.batch.rows_ref` is unpatterned but its example path is updated likewise.

**Implications.**
- `libs/dis-storage`: `build_object_path` produces the UUID segment; the inverse `parse_object_path` (added by the consumer slice) parses it. Hard rule 9's path text in CLAUDE.md is corrected to the UUID form.
- This resolves the §3.6 finding from the Slice 9 (now 9b) first plan: with identity carried as UUID and the path keyed by UUID, the worker writes the UUID to bronze and to the envelope with no external-form reconciliation. The external codes ride the envelope (D52) but are not in the path.
- The exact UUID character-class in each regex is finalized in plan mode against what `dis-storage` actually emits; the contracts carry the standard 8-4-4-4-12 hex form as drafted.

**Cross-refs.** D52 (identity-field correction), hard rule 9, D36 (the path that D36's "upload session id encoded in the path" wording referenced; that wording is corrected under D54). **Scope.** Contracts + `dis-storage` path scheme + hard rule 9 text; the path-producing code lands in the relevant slices (Phase 1 builds paths, the worker parses them).

---

### D54 CSV ingest is triggered by a `csv.received` event from dis-ui-server, not a raw GCS object-finalize; the worker trusts the event and resolves no identity `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (Slice 9a). Replaces the trigger model D36 implied for CSV-upload Phase 2. D36 left Phase 2 "event-triggered by GCS object-finalized notifications," which made the worker resolve identity itself (it received only a path) and assumed "the upload session id is encoded in the GCS object path", a carrier that does not exist in the live path scheme (D53 keys the path by UUID + trace_id, no session segment).

**Decision.** dis-ui-server publishes a `csv.received` event once the tenant's signed-PUT upload is confirmed saved in GCS. The `csv-ingest-worker` is triggered by `csv.received` and **trusts it**: identity (`tenant_id`/`store_id` UUIDs, plus codes) is already on the message because dis-ui-server resolved it at Phase 1 against the Identity Service (D37). The worker therefore **does not call `resolve_from_upload` and holds no Identity Service dependency**. `trace_id` is carried on `csv.received` (minted at Phase 1), so the worker reads it rather than parsing it from the object path. `upload_session_id` rides the event as the `source_payload_id` idempotency component and lineage, not as a resolve key.

**Why event-from-dis-ui-server, not GCS-finalize.** A raw GCS finalize carries no identity, forcing a re-resolve and a fragile path-parse; it also fires on every object in the bucket. A `csv.received` from dis-ui-server is a clean DIS envelope carrying resolved identity and the GCS pointer, and matches the trust model already used downstream (the streaming consumer trusts `ingress.ready` rather than re-resolving). The new event is a DIS Pub/Sub contract (`csv.received`, D52 field rules apply); it is distinct from `ingress.ready`, which the worker publishes only after bronze lands.

**Trust-boundary tradeoff (named).** The worker trusting dis-ui-server's identity means a dis-ui-server identity bug would propagate; re-resolving is rejected because it would only re-derive what dis-ui-server already knew. Downstream freshness (tenant/store deactivated between upload and processing) is the streaming consumer's `validate()`, not the worker's, so nothing is lost by dropping the worker's resolve.

**Open mechanic — CLOSED by D72 (Slice 8), superseded in part.** The fork below (client callback vs GCS-finalize subscription) is closed by removal: the upload is now synchronous (D72), dis-ui-server writes the object itself, and save-confirmation is the write return — no completion detection exists to need. The signed-PUT wording in the Decision above is likewise superseded (the trigger, the trust model, and the `upload_session_id`-as-`source_payload_id` role all stand; the value is now deterministically derived per D72, and one upload = one `trace_id` by construction). ~~How dis-ui-server learns the PUT completed (it issues the signed URL and is otherwise out of the loop): a client completion-callback to dis-ui-server, or dis-ui-server subscribing to GCS finalize itself and re-publishing `csv.received`. That is a Slice 9a / Slice 8 design point. Also confirm the upload-session-to-`trace_id` cardinality (whether one session can span more than one file/`trace_id`).~~

**Cross-refs.** D36 (the Phase-1/Phase-2 split this refines; its "encoded in the object path" wording is corrected here), D37 (translation at Phase 1), D52/D53 (contract + path), D5 (bronze-first still holds: the worker writes bronze then publishes `ingress.ready`). **Scope.** Contract (`csv.received`) + the trigger model; the publish point in dis-ui-server and the worker's subscription land in Slice 8 / Slice 9b.

---

### D55 `identity_mirror` gains `display_code`/`store_code`, copied as-is from Customer Master; the invented `t_*`/`s_*` external form is retired `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (Slice 9a). Closes the external-code question that surfaced alongside D37. Confirmed by live introspection of Customer Master: `core.tenants` carries `display_code` (text, **nullable**; e.g. `buc-ees`, `zabka-group`) and `core.stores` carries `store_code` (text, nullable; e.g. `TX-102`). These are the **only** authoritative external codes in the Ithina system; the contract's `t_*`/`s_*` matched neither and was a DIS invention.

**Correction (Slice 9a execution).** This entry originally recorded `display_code` as `NOT NULL` at source. Re-introspection of the live Customer Master (`information_schema.columns`, via the documented read-only access) shows **both** source columns are nullable (`is_nullable = YES`, no default). The mirror columns are nullable simply because the source columns are; the original "left nullable to avoid a copy-time constraint the source does not itself guarantee across history" justification is dropped as moot. The D48 test-CM harness models both columns nullable accordingly (a harness stricter than live would mask a real null path).

**Decision.** Add `display_code` to `identity_mirror.tenants` and `store_code` to `identity_mirror.stores`, copied **as-is** by Mirror Sync, consistent with the mirror's "faithful copy" posture (the mirror copies Customer Master columns verbatim, D12). Both mirror columns are **nullable**, matching the source. These codes are the authoritative readable form used for the optional `tenant_display_code`/`store_code` fields on the Pub/Sub envelopes (D52). They are **not** a translation bridge: external-to-internal resolution is the Identity Service returning the UUID (D37), not a mirror lookup.

**Why only these two columns.** Of everything in Customer Master's tenants/stores, only the external codes were both authoritative and missing from the mirror (the mirror already carries `name`, `status`, lifecycle timestamps). The codes are not load-bearing (the UUID is); they are added mainly to give the readable form an authoritative home and retire the invented `t_*`/`s_*` form for good. Other Customer Master columns are added later only if a consumer needs them (the evolve-in-step rule: the mirror grows when Customer Master grows and the column is relevant).

**Implications.**
- DDL: an Alembic migration adds the two columns (nullable). This reopens **Slice 7** (Mirror Sync, DB-pull) to select and upsert the new columns, with its tests; the change is additive.
- `identity.changed` payload carries `display_code`/`store_code` (D52) so the deferred Pub/Sub sync mode can populate them too.
- Identity Service returns the codes alongside the UUID (D37), so dis-ui-server can put them on `csv.received`.
- Backfill of existing mirror rows is the normal Mirror Sync run (idempotent via the conditional `IS DISTINCT FROM` upsert); the migration itself adds the nullable columns and does no backfill.

**Known gap (registered, out of 9a scope).** No `identity_mirror` drift guard exists — the both-directions live-introspection pattern covers `audit.events` and the canonical suites but not the mirror — so a future mirror column drift trips nothing; the de-facto reconciliation points are the Mirror Sync row models and upsert column lists.

**Cross-refs.** D37 (UUID translation; codes are readability, not the bridge), D52 (envelope code fields), D54 (`csv.received` carries codes), D12 (mirror as faithful copy + real FK), D46 (`status`). **Scope.** `identity_mirror` DDL + Mirror Sync (Slice 7) + this entry; lands in Slice 9a.


### D56 Two Customer Master contract shapes are DIS approximations pending CM sign-off: the JWT claim identifier values and the upload-session response `OPEN`

**Status.** `OPEN` (registered by Slice 9a). **Deadline: the Customer Master contract sign-off** (a Phase 0 TODO). This entry is a tracked loose end, not a settled contract: nothing here reads as DIS having settled the CM contract.

**Context.** Slice 9a retired the invented `t_*`/`s_*` identity form (D52) from the fixtures and the Slice 2 fakes. Two CM-owned artifact shapes had carried that form and needed a replacement now, before the real CM contract is signed. In both cases 9a uses the best available approximation — Customer Master's authoritative external codes (`display_code`/`store_code`, D55) — because the codes are real CM data while `t_*`/`s_*` never was, and because external-facing CM artifacts must not carry DIS-internal UUIDs.

**The two registered divergences.**
1. **JWT claim identifier values.** The test JWT claims (`tenant_id`/`store_id`, built by `dis_testing.fixtures.build_claims`) now carry `display_code`/`store_code` values. `contracts/identity-service/attribute-needs.md` §2 still pins the retired `^t_[a-z0-9]{12}$`/`^s_[a-z0-9]{12}$` patterns — that document is DIS's requirements input to the **unsigned** CM contract, so its patterns are CM vocabulary and are NOT rewritten by 9a; the file carries a one-line staleness flag pointing here. The real claim shape is CM's to define at sign-off.
2. **Upload-session response identifier values.** The CM fake's `UploadSessionResponse.tenant_id`/`store_id` now carry the codes (`store_id` null for a code-less store). The real CM upload-session API shape has never been seen; this is an approximation of an unseen contract, flagged for the same sign-off.

**Resolution path.** At CM contract sign-off: confirm (or replace) the claim identifier vocabulary and the upload-session response shape; update `attribute-needs.md`, `dis_testing.fixtures.build_claims`, and the CM fake to the signed shapes; close this entry. The Identity Service contract itself (UUID + codes out, D37) is NOT in question here — only the CM-artifact input shapes the fakes approximate.

**Cross-refs.** D37 (Identity Service returns the UUID), D52 (invented form retired), D55 (the authoritative codes), D48 (the test-CM harness these fakes pair with). **Scope.** Register entry + the one-line flag in `attribute-needs.md`; fixture/fake approximations land in Slice 9a.


### D57 mypy --strict gate: the predicted pandera per-module relaxation proved unnecessary `SETTLED`

**Status.** `SETTLED` (Slice 9d). The 9d scoping report predicted dis-validation might need a narrow per-module mypy override where pandera's typing blocked strict mode; in execution every dis-validation error was our own annotation gap, so dis-validation is fully strict-enforced with **no override** — this entry documents that outcome and registers no relaxation.


### D58 Bronze idempotency is query-based and single-worker; `store_id` stays nullable with a registered channel-scoped tightening gap `OPEN`

**Status.** `OPEN` (registered by Slice 9b; forward-looking, no DDL now). Two related bronze-schema facts the worker build surfaced, both verified by live introspection of `bronze.data_ingress_events` on 5433.

**1. The dedup key has no constraint or supporting index — correct for a SINGLE worker instance only.** The Slice 9b idempotency key is `(tenant_id [RLS], source_payload_id = upload_session_id, payload_sha256)` within a 24h window measured against the prior row's `received_at` (the only NOT NULL persisted timestamp; the producer's `csv.received.received_ts` is producer-controlled and skews under redelivery/late delivery, so it is NOT the dedup clock). The live schema carries **no UNIQUE constraint over this key** — correctly, since a rolling *window* cannot be expressed as a plain unique index — so the check is a query (`SELECT ... WHERE source_payload_id = :spid AND payload_sha256 = :sha AND received_at >= :cutoff`). **The explicit operating assumption: the worker runs as ONE instance.** Two *concurrent* identical deliveries processed by concurrent instances could both pass the SELECT and double-write; redelivery to a single instance cannot (the lookup precedes the insert in the same process). **Any future "scale the worker horizontally" change MUST first revisit this entry** and add a real concurrency guard (e.g. a partial unique index over `(tenant_id, source_payload_id, payload_sha256)` + `ON CONFLICT` semantics with window logic applied at read, or an advisory-lock scheme); silently scaling instances breaks dedup. Secondary gap, same trigger: no index supports the dedup lookup (`ix_bdie_tenant_source_received_at` covers `source_id`, the channel — not `source_payload_id`); at beta volume the scan is irrelevant, at scale the same future change should add one.

**2. `store_id` nullability vs the single-store upload session.** `csv.received.store_id` is contract-REQUIRED ("an upload session is bound to exactly one store at session creation"), so every worker-written `csv_upload` bronze row carries a `store_id`. The live column stays NULL-able because bronze is shared across all four ingress channels and a chunk-level `store_id` is legitimately NULL where store is per-row inside the chunk (e.g. ERP batches; per-row store binding happens at the canonical write via the composite FK, D39). The registered tightening for a future migration slice: a **channel-scoped CHECK** (`dis_channel <> 'csv_upload' OR store_id IS NOT NULL`), not a blanket NOT NULL. The pre-9b smoke rows (NULL `store_id`, NULL `source_payload_id`/`payload_sha256`, `source_id='manual_csv_upload'`) predate the worker, can never match the non-NULL dedup equality, and do not define the contract.

**Cross-refs.** D54 (upload_session_id as the source_payload_id component), D5 (bronze-first), D59 (what a dedup hit does), D39 (the canonical no-orphan guarantee this does NOT replace), D38 (the canonical-side dedup-column gap this is the bronze analog of — distinct: here the columns EXIST, only the constraint posture is registered). **Owner of the resolution:** the first slice that scales the worker beyond one instance, or a dedicated bronze-hardening migration slice.


### D59 csv-ingest-worker redelivery semantics: resume-and-mark — no second publish if the prior ingest published; complete the publish if it did not `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (Slice 9b, operator-decided). Refines Slice 9b acceptance criterion 7, whose original wording ("no second publish", unconditional) is updated to match; recorded here so the refinement is explicit, not drift.

**Decision.** The worker stamps `published_at` + `processing_status='PUBLISHED'` AFTER the `ingress.ready` publish (the columns exist in the live bronze schema for exactly this lifecycle). On a dedup hit (same content hash + upload session + tenant within the 24h window):
- prior `PUBLISHED` → **full no-op**: return the prior `trace_id`, no second bronze row, no second publish (audit `RECEIVED`/`SKIPPED` with `prior_trace_id` in `event_data`, the D42 pattern).
- prior `FAILED` (a preflight-failed ingest) → full no-op likewise: redelivery of the same bad bytes never re-runs preflight and never publishes.
- prior `RECEIVED` with `published_at` NULL (a crash/outage between the bronze write and the publish) → **resume and mark**: publish `ingress.ready` under the PRIOR ingest's `trace_id` with the prior `bronze_ref`, then stamp the publish. No second bronze row.

**Why.** Write-then-publish (D5) under at-least-once delivery means crash-between-write-and-publish is a real state; a strict unconditional no-op would stall that chunk until the (future, unbuilt) D5 sweeper. Resume-and-mark converges on redelivery with no stall. The cost — a rare duplicate `ingress.ready` when the mark itself fails after a successful publish — is tolerated by design: Pub/Sub is at-least-once anyway and the streaming consumer dedups (D33/Slice 10).

**Related note (the two `received_ts`).** `csv.received.received_ts` is the producer's timestamp (dis-ui-server confirming the GCS save); `ingress.ready.received_ts` is when DIS durably accepted the chunk — the bronze row's `received_at`, stamped by the worker. They are distinct instants on one flow; downstream readers of both must not conflate them, and the dedup window is measured against bronze `received_at` only.

**Cross-refs.** D5 (bronze-first; the sweeper remains the recovery for messages lost outside the redelivery path), D54 (trace_id is read, never minted — the resume publishes under the prior's), D44 (duplicate audit tolerated), D58 (the single-worker assumption the dedup query rests on). **Scope.** csv-ingest-worker semantics + the slice-doc criterion-7 wording update; lands in Slice 9b.


### D60 Pub/Sub ordering key described in contracts but not implemented `OPEN`

**Status.** `OPEN` (registered at the Slice 9b commit gate, from the slice's adversarial self-validation). Both `csv.received` and `ingress.ready` describe `tenant_id` as the Pub/Sub ordering key, but no producer sets one (worker publisher, dis-testing publishers, test publishes). Ordering keys need a publisher attribute + ordering-enabled subscriptions, absent from the repo. Left in 9b because no consumer depends on ordering (Slice 10 unbuilt) and canonical correctness is event-time-based (D7, D33). **Resolution:** when the first ordering-sensitive consumer lands (Slice 10), implement the ordering-key convention end to end OR strike the description from both contracts. **Cross-refs.** D7, D33, D54.


### D61 Named-custom-transform escape hatch deferred (declarative-only mapping stance) `DEFERRED`.

The mapping engine stays declarative-only (the Slice 5 bounded vocabulary). A gap the vocabulary cannot express is an onboarding problem (fix the mapping or extend the shared vocabulary) or schema drift (detect and fail), not a per-source code path. No named-transform registry is built. Trigger: a concrete source that defeats both the declarative vocabulary and a vocabulary extension. Cross-ref: Slice 5, Slice 10.


### D62 Proactive schema-drift monitoring deferred (reactive detection stands) — DEFERRED.

Drift is caught reactively: structural drift by the pre-mapping source-shape suite, format drift by normalization, both routed to the failure disposition (Slice 10) and quarantine (Slice 11). No standalone watcher or pre-processing schema comparison is built. Trigger: reactive detection proves insufficient in pilot (a drift class slips past both suites), or a tenant SLA requires proactive drift alerting. Cross-ref: Slice 5, Slice 10.


### D64 Event-time-wins comparison uses a typed hot-table column, not JSONB `SETTLED` (landed by migration 0003)

**Decision.** Event-time-wins on `store_sku_current_position` (architecture 2.3.1: a
late-arriving older event must not overwrite newer state) needs a stored reference
event-time to compare against. The live hot table had only `last_updated_at` (write-time,
DB-generated), no source event-time column. The comparison timestamp is stored as a
first-class typed column `last_source_event_at TIMESTAMPTZ` on
`store_sku_current_position`; the upsert is conditional
(`DO UPDATE ... WHERE incoming source event ts >= stored ts`). This column landed on the
same prerequisite migration that resolves D38's event-table dedup columns
(`source_id`/`source_event_id`); it was a prerequisite for the Slice 10 build, not
authored under Slice 10 service code.

**Alternatives.** (1) Store the source event timestamp in the consumer-injected
`ingest_metadata` JSONB (no DDL). Rejected: a load-bearing correctness value belongs in a
typed column, not untyped JSONB; the no-DDL-in-slice rule means surface-and-register the
schema gap (as with D38), not route around it through JSONB. (2) Last-write-wins for v1.0:
unconditional update. Rejected: violates architecture 2.3.1.

**Why.** Event-time-wins is a hard architectural invariant; typing the comparison value
keeps it indexable and explicit and matches the project's typed-schema posture. The perf
delta versus JSONB is negligible at beta scale, so correctness-typing decides, not
performance.

**Prerequisite (discharged).** The migration adding `last_source_event_at` (with the D38
columns) — `alembic/versions/0003_canonical_dedup_event_time.py` (M-D38/D64) — landed and
was verified before the Slice 10 dual-write and event-time-wins proofs. NULL means never
event-written (e.g. pre-seeded catalogue rows); the column is nullable by design.

**Cross-ref.** D38 (shared prerequisite migration), D30, D33, architecture 2.3.1, Slice 10.


### D63 Sales for a first-seen SKU fail loud; catalogue/position onboards before sales `SETTLED`

**Decision.** When the streaming consumer processes a sale-event chunk for a SKU with no
existing `store_sku_current_position` hot row, the hot-table INSERT arm of the dual-write
cannot satisfy the hot-only NOT NULL catalogue columns (`product_name`,
`product_category`, `currency`, etc.). The v1.0 posture is fail loud: the NOT NULL
violation rolls back the whole batch (D30 either-or-neither), the chunk goes to the
minimal failure disposition (Slice 10), on to quarantine (Slice 11), and is replayed
(Slice 12) once catalogue/position has onboarded. No hot-side no-op or skip path is
introduced. This makes catalogue/position-before-sales a v1.0 onboarding-order invariant:
sales for an unseen SKU quarantine until that SKU's position data lands.

**Post-mapping validation projection.** The post-mapping canonical-shape suite validates
each event chunk against its per-event-model projection (sale: `current_retail_price`,
`unit_cost`, `currency`, `promo_identifier`, plus the natural-key triple), not one
monolithic all-columns canonical model, so a sale chunk is never failed merely for lacking
hot-only catalogue columns. The fail-loud is the genuine first-seen-SKU case, not a
validation artifact.

**Alternatives.** (1) Update-only for event chunks: ON CONFLICT update projected columns
when the hot row exists; when absent, insert the event row and record a hot-side no-op.
Rejected: invents a skip path the architecture does not describe and weakens the "both
land" reading of D30. (2) Defer to operator review. Resolved here instead.

**Why.** Faithful to the project-wide no-silent-fallback posture (code-quality rule 4) and
to architecture 2.3.2 (UPSERT unconditionally). The recovery path is already built (failure
disposition, quarantine, replay); first-seen-SKU sales are not lost, they wait.

**Tradeoff acknowledged.** A tenant that sends sales before onboarding catalogue/position
sees those sales quarantine until catalogue lands. A deliberate ordering constraint
surfaced to onboarding, not a silent drop.

**REVISED (service-amendment gate, operator-ratified): hot-row creation is
COMPLETENESS-gated, not event-type-gated.** PostgreSQL validates NOT NULL on the INSERT
candidate tuple BEFORE conflict arbitration (verified live, role-independent), so the
"INSERT arm fails NOT NULL" mechanism above cannot exist for event projections at all —
they can never ride an `INSERT … ON CONFLICT` statement, even for a seen SKU. The
ratified posture:

- The discriminator is derived from the live hot schema (NOT NULL + CHECK partition):
  the consumer injects `id`/`tenant_id`/`store_id`/`trace_id`/`tax_treatment`/
  `mapping_version_id`/`dis_channel` regardless of event; the projection must supply
  `sku_id` (the natural key, universal) plus `product_name`, `product_category`,
  `current_retail_price`, `unit_cost`, `currency`, honouring the presence-pairing CHECKs
  (`promo_identifier ⇒ promo_price`; expiry triple all-or-none). **Complete** = the
  assembled candidate satisfies every NOT NULL and CHECK, resolved PER MAPPING at load
  (`LoadedMapping.hot_complete`); value-level violations remain loud at write.
- **COMPLETE mapping** (none exists in production today; the future catalogue slice):
  the proven atomic `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (COALESCE key) DO UPDATE … WHERE
  event-time-wins` — creates or updates; the only path that inserts.
- **INCOMPLETE mapping** (every current path): one conditional UPDATE with the
  event-time-wins predicate; rowcount 0 → one READ-ONLY existence check → present =
  older-event no-op (audited); absent = a D63 miss. **The miss does not abort the batch
  transaction: the appended event rows COMMIT (history retained), then the sink raises
  loudly so the chunk nacks toward quarantine (Slice 11).** No INSERT exists on this
  path under any concurrency. Redelivery re-appends events (read-time dedup absorbs)
  until catalogue/position onboards, then the merge succeeds.

The original "rolls back the whole batch" wording above is superseded for the
first-seen case: a D63 miss is a defined disposition (history retained, hot pending),
not a write failure; genuine in-transaction failures (CHECKs, partitions, infra) still
roll back both sides (D30 unchanged).

**Cross-ref.** D30, D33, D58 split, D64, M-HOTKEY/0004, Slice 10 (the completeness
classification + two-path merge), Slice 11 (quarantine), Slice 12 (replay).


### D65 Id-less-source `source_event_id` fallback is redelivery-stable, NOT correction-collapsing `SETTLED` (limitation registered)

**Decision.** When a source supplies no native event identifier — all change events (the
live schema carries no source event-id column for them) and any sale row missing
`transaction_id`/`line_item_seq` — the consumer derives
`source_event_id = bronze_ref || ':' || chunk_row_index`. Properties, stated plainly:

- **Redelivery dedups:** the same `ingress.ready` redelivered re-reads the same bronze
  object, so each row reproduces its `source_event_id` and the D33 window collapses the
  replay at read.
- **A re-uploaded correction does NOT collapse:** a corrected file is a new bronze object,
  so its rows carry different keys; two distinct events survive the read-time window for
  these sources. The hot table still converges (event-time-wins, D64), so current truth is
  correct; the event-history read shows both rows.
- This is the honest semantics when a source asserts no event identity — DIS does not
  invent correlation the source never claimed.

**Trigger to revisit.** A concrete source that supplies no native event id but requires
correction-collapse at the event-history read.

**Evidence.** `services/streaming-consumer/tests/integration/test_read_time_dedup.py::test_idless_correction_documented`
proves the accepted behavior (a distinct-bronze correction yields two non-collapsing
events; hot converges).

**Cross-ref.** D33, D38, D64, Slice 10.

### D66 csv-ingest-worker bronze dedup is single-instance-safe only — PARKED, resume after dis-ui-server

**Status.** OPEN, parked. This is D58 split-(b), promoted to its own entry so it is not
lost inside the D58 retraction note. Surfaced during Slice 10 when D58's single-instance
assumption was retracted for the streaming consumer (autoscaling posture).

**The gap.** The csv-ingest-worker (Slice 9b) enforces bronze idempotency with a 24h
query-based check-then-act (SELECT for a prior bronze row within the window; if none, write
the bronze row and publish ingress.ready; resume-and-mark on an unpublished prior). This was
explicitly safe only under the single-worker assumption (D58). With single-instance
retracted, if the WORKER autoscales, two instances can both run the SELECT, both see no
prior, and both write a bronze row and both publish ingress.ready.

**Severity (as currently understood, not yet verified).** Likely waste, not corruption: the
streaming consumer's read-time dedup (D33) plus redelivery-stable keys (D65) should absorb a
duplicate ingress.ready downstream, so canonical truth converges. The cost is duplicate
bronze rows, duplicate publishes, double-processing, and a messy audit trail under
concurrency. Confirm this severity when resuming; do not assume the downstream absorption is
complete without checking the duplicate's path.

**This is NOT the canonical hot-key problem.** The Slice 10 fix (M-HOTKEY: COALESCE-sentinel
arbiter index for a nullable composite natural key defeating PG15 ON CONFLICT) does NOT
transfer here. The worker's issue is query-based idempotency (a check-then-act race), not
NULLS-NOT-DISTINCT arbitration. Different mechanism, different fix.

**First task when resuming (all derive-from-live, plan mode).** Introspect
bronze.data_ingress_events: what the dedup key actually is, whether any UNIQUE constraint
exists on it, and exactly how the worker's 24h-window query + resume-and-mark is coded. Only
then choose the fix.

**Candidate fixes (no choice made here).**
1. Add a UNIQUE constraint on the bronze dedup key so a second concurrent write fails loud —
   the database backstop the canonical path got via uq_sscp_natural_key. Likely needs its
   own migration.
2. Advisory lock on the dedup key around the check-then-act, so concurrent workers serialize
   on the same key.
3. Accept the duplicate at the worker and lean entirely on the consumer's D33 read-time
   dedup to absorb it — cheapest, but duplicate bronze rows and duplicate publishes become
   normal under autoscale (audit/cost consequence).

**Scope when taken up.** A worker-hardening slice of its own (touches the shipped, pushed
csv-ingest-worker — plan→approve→execute→gate, and a migration gate of its own if fix 1).
Trigger: before the worker is deployed with >1 instance OR autoscaling is enabled for it.
Sequencing: parked behind the dis-ui-server service work.

**Cross-ref.** D58 (retraction + split), D5 (bronze recoverable source), D33/D65 (downstream
absorption), M-HOTKEY/Slice 10 (the DIFFERENT problem this is not), Slice 9b (the worker).

### Slice 10 register notes: D42 and D60 closed; carried limits named `RESOLVED/CARRIED`

**D42 → RESOLVED (the `event_data` JSONB path; no DDL).** A dedup-key hit emits a
ROW-scoped `CANONICAL_WRITTEN` audit event with `outcome = SUCCESS` (the append-only
insert genuinely landed; the live CHECK vocabulary is honoured) and the duplicate detail
in `event_data`: `{"duplicate": "DUPLICATE_NOOP"|"DUPLICATE_OVERWRITTEN",
"prior_trace_id", "row_hash", "dedup_key": {store_id, source_id, source_event_id}}`.
`row_hash` is sha256 over the orjson-serialized, key-sorted mapping-produced payload.
NOOP-versus-OVERWRITTEN is decided by comparing the new row's hash against the prior
latest row's payload re-hashed the same way. **Carried, not addressed:** the drift-guard
type-narrowing limit (a narrowed column type passes dis-audit's name-set match and is
caught only at INSERT, then swallowed by fire-and-forget) — fixing it means per-column
type reconciliation in `libs/dis-audit`, outside Slice 10's blast radius; trigger: the
next slice touching the dis-audit reconciliation. **Also registered:** dis-audit's closed
`Stage` enum has no consumer-fetch member; intake+fetch audit under `RECEIVED`
(`service_name` disambiguates); `IDENTITY_VALIDATED` is never emitted (no identity call
exists, D28).

**D60 → RESOLVED (STRIKE).** The "Used as the Pub/Sub ordering key." sentence is struck
from `tenant_id` in BOTH `contracts/pubsub/csv.received.schema.json` and
`ingress.ready.schema.json` (description-only; `schema_version` stays 1, the
never-deployed-draft posture per D52; the 9b drift guards compare field sets, not
descriptions — verified, no producer/consumer/test code change). Why strike, not
implement: no correctness property needs ordering (canonical truth is event-time-based —
D33 read-time dedup, D64 event-time-wins; the redelivery and out-of-order proofs in the
Slice 10 suite pass without it); implementing would amend a shipped service (9b's
publisher), require ordering-enabled subscriptions, and accept per-key serialized publish
throughput for a guarantee the worker hop (nack/redelivery, D59 resume) already breaks.
A regression test asserts neither contract mentions an ordering key.

**PG15 ON CONFLICT limitation (Slice 10 implementation note on D64; D30 NOT reopened).**
Verified empirically on the live 15.17: an ON CONFLICT arbiter over the NULLS NOT DISTINCT
hot natural key does NOT detect a conflict when key values are NULL (both the column-list
and ON CONSTRAINT forms take the INSERT arm); the NND unique index still enforces
uniqueness on write. The D64 conditional upsert is therefore implemented as a conditional
UPDATE (`IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` key predicate + the event-time-wins condition), an
existence check, then a plain INSERT — all three statements INSIDE the same per-batch
`rls_session` transaction as the event-table insert, so D30's either-or-neither holds
unchanged at the batch grain (this note changes the upsert MECHANISM only, never the
transaction boundary or D30 itself). Concurrency rests on the v1.0
single-consumer-instance assumption (the D58 posture family); a racing duplicate still
hits the unique index (`uq_sscp_natural` enforcement with NULL segments is proven on the
live engine by `test_nnd_unique_index_enforces_on_null_segments`; the CONCURRENT
two-transaction variant was demonstrated live in the Slice 10 adversarial pass — the
second writer blocks on the speculative index entry, raises on the first's commit, and
rolls back whole, one row surviving), fails the batch loudly, rolls back whole, and
redelivery converges — never a silent double-write. **The single-instance assumption is
UNENFORCED at runtime:** no deploy config, lock, or subscription setting limits the
consumer to one instance (a Pub/Sub subscription actively permits many pullers), and
Slice 10 deliberately adds no deploy config. It is a DEPLOY-TIME OBLIGATION owned by the
slice that first deploys or horizontally scales the consumer (the reserved `deploy/`
tree): max-one-instance, or revisit this note and D58 together with a real concurrency
guard. Until then a second instance degrades safely (loud batch failures + redelivery),
never silently.

**SUPERSEDED (M-HOTKEY/0004 + the completeness-gated two-path merge — see the D58 split
entry and REVISED D63).** The deployment posture is autoscaling, so the read-modify-write
mechanism this note describes is RETIRED. Migration 0004 replaced `uq_sscp_natural` with
the COALESCE-sentinel arbiter index `uq_sscp_natural_key` (+ sentinel CHECKs), restoring
`INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` arbitration for all key shapes including NULL segments.
A second live finding then shaped the service side: **PostgreSQL validates NOT NULL on
the INSERT candidate BEFORE arbitration**, so only a COMPLETE candidate may ride the
ON CONFLICT statement. The Slice 10 service amendment therefore implements the
completeness-gated two-path merge (REVISED D63): complete mappings (future catalogue
path) use the proven atomic ON CONFLICT statement; incomplete mappings (all current
paths) use a conditional UPDATE whose rowcount-0 case is a READ-ONLY check → older-event
no-op or a D63 miss (event history committed, loud raise after) — NO INSERT exists on
the incomplete path, so the create-race that doomed the read-modify-write cannot occur.
Both paths: per-batch sorted-key order, one rls_session transaction (D30 unchanged),
EvalPlanQual re-evaluation of the event-time-wins predicate against the locked current
row (D64 unchanged, concurrency-proven per path). The deploy-time single-instance
obligation above is RESCINDED for streaming-consumer ONLY; a
single-instance-or-fixed-dedup obligation attaches to csv-ingest-worker instead (the
D58 split entry, item (b)). `test_nnd_unique_index_enforces_on_null_segments` retires
with the mechanism it proved.

**Carried scope limits (Slice 10).** (1) Non-NULL `pre/post_validation_suite_ref`
(`module:ClassName`) is unsupported — raises `SuiteDefinitionError`; NULL=default is the
only live state; trigger: the first mapping needing an authored suite. (2) `mapping.changed`
event-driven refresh deferred (D6): the mapping read is per-lookup, zero-staleness;
trigger: measured per-chunk SELECT cost or an operator latency requirement. (3) Within-batch
dedup-key repeats are not flagged as duplicates in audit — the duplicate-detect SELECT
reads only PRIOR COMMITTED rows, so two same-key rows inside ONE batch both insert
(append-only, correct) with no DUPLICATE_* ROW event between them; the audit duplicate
rate therefore undercounts within-file repeats that land in the same ≤500-row batch.
Bounded: cross-BATCH repeats within one chunk ARE flagged (each batch commits before the
next opens), and the read-time window still collapses within-batch peers (identical
transaction-stable `last_updated_at`; the uuidv7 `id DESC` tie-break makes the LAST-built
row the survivor, deterministically). Hot-side within-batch natural-key repeats carry no
such gap at all: `_group_hot` merges them in memory before any SQL, exactly one
UPDATE-or-INSERT per key per batch — no NND collision, no silent overwrite (column-scoped
event-time-wins applied in the merge). (4) The rolling event-partition creator remains a registered gap
(M-D38/D64 gate); out-of-window writes error loudly (no DEFAULT partition) into the
failure disposition. (5) A `StreamingConsumerError` family in dis-core is a registered
want (the service reuses `DisError`/`EventContractError`/`EventPathMismatchError`;
dis-core was outside the slice blast radius); trigger: the next dis-core-touching slice.
(6) `CHANGE_HOT_PROJECTION` has NO register anchor: the change-event
`(event_category, attribute_name) → hot column` pairs (PRICE/current_retail_price,
COST/unit_cost, INVENTORY/stock_qty, CATALOGUE/product_name, STATUS/sku_status) are a
consumer convention authored in `pipeline/mapping.py` — unlike the sale projection,
which D63 pins. End-to-end exercised only for `(INVENTORY, stock_qty)`; the other four
are registry-image-asserted only, and a unit test enforces that every pair is an
IDENTITY mapping (attribute X → hot column X), so a typo'd pair fails loudly rather
than mis-routing an UPDATE. Owner of the anchor: the first slice with an independent
reader of the registry (the quarantine console, Slice 11, or mapping authoring,
Slice 14) registers or amends the pairs. (7) **Production enablement of the complete
create-path:** no current production mapping carries the catalogue NOT NULL columns
(`product_name`, `product_category`, …), so every live source classifies INCOMPLETE
and hot-row creation is unreachable in production today — the mechanism is built
(REVISED D63), the enablement is not. Enablement = a source authored to carry the
discriminating columns (with registry/routing support for catalogue targets) or a
revisit of the hot NOT NULL set; owner: onboarding / Slice 14.

### D58 single-instance posture under autoscaling: SPLIT (M-HOTKEY) — consumer SOLVED; worker bronze dedup a NOW-LIVE OPEN gap

**Posture change.** The deployment posture is AUTOSCALING (multiple instances per
service). The single-instance operating assumption D58 recorded is therefore no longer a
tolerable footing anywhere it is load-bearing. This entry SPLITS the assumption's two
dependents — it is deliberately NOT a clean "D58 retracted":

**(a) streaming-consumer hot path — SOLVED.** Migration `0004_hot_natural_key_arbitration`
(M-HOTKEY) replaces the NULLS NOT DISTINCT natural-key constraint (which PG15 cannot
arbitrate for NULL key segments — the limitation that had forced a single-instance-only
read-modify-write upsert) with the unique COALESCE-sentinel expression index
`uq_sscp_natural_key` plus two sentinel CHECKs (`sku_variant <> ''`,
`sku_lot_batch <> ''`; the empty string is operator-confirmed never legitimate and is now
engine-impossible). Atomic `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (COALESCE target) DO UPDATE … WHERE
event-time-wins` is thereby restored and is concurrency-safe under N instances — proven
on live 15.17 with two real concurrent writers: the insert-race loser takes the UPDATE
branch (no error surfaces); the `DO UPDATE … WHERE` predicate re-evaluates against the
LOCKED current row, so an older event can never overwrite a newer one in either arrival
order; deadlocks from overlapping batches are eliminated by the deterministic per-batch
natural-key sort (demonstrated: opposite-order interleave deadlocks, total-order commits).
The Slice 10 service amendment swaps the upsert mechanism accordingly.

**(b) csv-ingest-worker bronze dedup — NOW-LIVE OPEN gap.** D58's original subject: the
worker's idempotency check is a query (no UNIQUE over the dedup key, no concurrency
guard) and is single-instance-safe ONLY. Under the autoscaling posture this is no longer
a forward-looking note — it is a live exposure the moment the worker runs with more than
one instance: two concurrent identical deliveries can both pass the SELECT and
double-write bronze. **Status: OPEN. Owner: a worker-hardening slice. Trigger: the
csv-ingest-worker is deployed with >1 instance, or autoscaling is enabled for it.** Until
then the worker carries a single-instance-or-fixed-dedup deploy obligation (below). The
consumer fix in (a) does NOT cover this; system-wide autoscaling is not handled by this
entry.

**Deploy obligations restated.** The single-instance deploy-time obligation previously
recorded against the streaming consumer (the Slice 10 adversarial pass) is **RESCINDED
for streaming-consumer ONLY** — its hot path is concurrency-safe by (a). A
single-instance-or-fixed-dedup obligation now attaches to **csv-ingest-worker** per (b).
"Rescinded" does not mean "no instance constraint anywhere."

**Cross-refs.** D58 (the original assumption; its bronze posture is the (b) gap), D30
(transaction boundary unchanged), D63/D64 (semantics unchanged, now concurrency-proven),

### D67 dis-ui-server uses the SQLAlchemy ORM/declarative layer; other services use Core/text `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (Slice 13a, registered in plan mode, number assigned at the commit
gate).

**Decision.** dis-ui-server uses SQLAlchemy's ORM/declarative layer, justified by its CRUD
and system-of-record nature (`config.source_mappings` and later mapping/onboarding writes),
where the stream/transform/worker services use Core/text. Load-bearing constraint: every
ORM model executes only through the dis-rls `rls_session` (hard rule 1), never a raw
`AsyncSession` or a second engine. The layer choice is the deviation; the through-dis-rls
constraint is what preserves the foundation rule.

**Cross-refs.** D26 (BFF), hard rule 1 (RLS via dis-rls). **Scope.** dis-ui-server + this
entry; no DDL.

### D68 config.source_mappings mapping grain is (tenant_id, source_id, template_id) `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (Slice 14a, registered in plan mode, number assigned at the commit
gate).

**Decision.** A `(tenant_id, source_id)` source carries multiple named mapping templates
(e.g. `manual_csv_upload` carrying sales, inventory, pricing); the mapping grain becomes
`(tenant_id, source_id, template_id)`. `template_id` (UUIDv7, minted server-side at DRAFT
creation, immutable once set) is a grain dimension, NOT a primary key: `mapping_version_id`
stays the global BIGSERIAL surrogate, the canonical-row pin, and the audit reference (D22
unchanged). `template_name` is the operator-set human label, unique per
`(tenant_id, source_id)` among non-DEPRECATED rows; active-uniqueness and the version
sequence (`version_seq_per_source`, name kept to avoid contract churn) are rekeyed to the
template grain, each template's lineage starting at 1. Pre-14a rows were backfilled with
one minted template per `(tenant, source)` group, named `default` (lineage preserved,
never per-row minting).

**Cross-refs.** D15 (mapping config in Postgres, versioned), D17 (staged-rollout lifecycle
the grain keys respect), D22 (pin unchanged), D49 (`mapping_rules` shape untouched), D69
(RLS ON on the same table). **Scope.** Alembic 0005 + the `schemas/postgres` manifest; no
service code. Owed downstream: the Slice 10 template-keyed consumer lookup
(`load_active_mapping` takes `.first()` and must key on template before any second
template goes ACTIVE under one source), the Slice 8 upload-session template carry, the
Slice 14b per-template `version`/`active_version` contract surfacing and the label's
template component.

### D69 config.source_mappings RLS ON (ENABLE + FORCE, single-GUC tenant policy) `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (Slice 14a, registered in plan mode, number assigned at the commit
gate).

**Decision.** `config.source_mappings` carries `tenant_id` and its rows are per-tenant
data, so it follows the DIS principle (RLS ON wherever `tenant_id` exists): ENABLE + FORCE
with the same single-GUC `app.tenant_id` `tenant_isolation` policy as the other DIS tenant
tables. The prior DDL comment ("holds configuration, not tenant data", with a claimed
cross-tenant startup read) is corrected — the live consumer reads the mapping per-lookup
inside a tenant-scoped `rls_session` (D6 side input), so no cross-tenant read exists. The
two-GUC `app.user_type` pattern remains Customer-Master-replica-only. Riders, decided with
this entry: (1) the `btree_gist` extension is added for the EXCLUDE name-uniqueness
constraint (`ex_csm_template_name_per_source`; a plain unique index cannot express
name-to-template uniqueness because version rows of one template share a name); (2)
`config.source_mappings_v` is set `security_invoker = true`, closing the owner-rights RLS
bypass (verified live: the only view in the database, zero SECURITY DEFINER functions);
(3) the test-infra updates (seeder GUC scoping, pinned fixture template, consumer conftest,
seed tests) were a necessary consequence of RLS-ON — a scope clarification of
"schema-only", not row-write scope creep.

**Cross-refs.** D68 (the grain on the same table), D24/hard rule 1 (isolation posture),
D6 (consumer side-input read). **Scope.** Alembic 0005 + the `schemas/postgres` manifest +
the dis-testing/consumer test infra; no service code, no policy change on any other table.

### D70 store-list tenant isolation is an in-query predicate, not RLS `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (Slice 14b, registered in plan mode, number assigned at the commit
gate). A registered WEAK LINK with a revisit trigger, not a settled-forever posture.

**Decision.** `GET /api/v1/stores-onboarded` (dis-ui-server) scopes by an explicit
`WHERE tenant_id = <token tenant>` in `repos/stores.py` because `identity_mirror` is RLS-OFF
(D41); there is no database backstop, so a missing predicate is a cross-tenant leak.
Containment: a single chokepoint (the predicate lives in exactly one repo function; no other
module queries the store model) plus a mutation-killing test posture — removing the predicate
fails four isolation tests (exact-rows-per-tenant, A-cannot-see-B disjointness,
unknown-tenant-empty, tenant-from-token-only against a smuggled query param and header). The
read still runs inside `rls_session` so the engine's wrong-database/NOBYPASSRLS posture guard
applies; the GUC is simply a no-op on the RLS-OFF table.

**Revisit trigger.** Bring `identity_mirror` under RLS (or an equivalent database-level
backstop) before it carries more tenant-facing read surface than this one endpoint. Any new
tenant-facing read of `identity_mirror.*` re-opens this entry rather than copying the
predicate pattern.

**Cross-refs.** D41 (`identity_mirror` RLS-off resolution), D67 (the ORM layer this read
uses), D69 (the contrasting RLS-ON posture on `config.source_mappings`). **Scope.**
dis-ui-server `repos/stores.py` + its isolation tests + this entry; no DDL.


### D71 Consumer mapping lookup is template-unaware; the template-keyed fix is owed as Slice 8a, gated before any second ACTIVE template `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (Slice 8a). The consumer lookup is template-keyed: `load_active_mapping` carries `AND template_id = CAST(:template_id AS uuid)` (the predicate at `mapping.py:199`, `.first()` at `mapping.py:208` — the registration below cited `mapping.py:188-194`, which predated the Slice 8 rebase), bound from the `ingress.ready` envelope's required field. The live `uq_csm_active_per_source` index `(tenant_id, source_id, template_id) WHERE status='ACTIVE'` makes the keyed lookup single-row, so `.first()` is exact, never arbitrary; a `template_id` naming no ACTIVE row raises a template-grained `MappingConfigError`, never a silent wrong-mapping. `template_id` is recorded on the `MAPPING_LOOKED_UP` audit `event_data`. Mutation-proven: removing the predicate fails the two-ACTIVE-templates integration test (the alt chunk receives the default template's row — the exact hazard below), the unknown-template test, and the inverse source pin — three independent kills. **The hard gate is LIFTED: a promote-to-ACTIVE path that can produce a second ACTIVE template per source is now safe to build (the promote/reject/shadow slice is unblocked).**

*Registration (historical).* The streaming consumer's `load_active_mapping` selected the mapping by `(tenant_id, source_id, status='ACTIVE')` and took `.first()`, with no `template_id` predicate. Since 14a, the live `uq_csm_active_per_source` index permits multiple ACTIVE rows per `(tenant, source)`, one per template (D68), so the consumer's lookup was template-unaware: deterministic only because the 0005 backfill leaves exactly one ACTIVE 'default' template per source. The moment a second template went ACTIVE under one source, `.first()` would return an arbitrary row and a CSV could be processed with the wrong template's `mapping_rules`, silently, with no error.

**Decision.** Slice 8 carries `template_id` end to end on the wire now (the `csv.received` and `ingress.ready` contracts gain a required `template_id`; dis-ui-server populates it; the worker passes it through; bronze persists it for replay lineage), but the consumer is NOT amended in Slice 8 (carried-but-ignored, which is safe in the current single-ACTIVE-per-source world). The consumer template-keyed-lookup fix is owed as **Slice 8a**, taken up immediately after Slice 8 lands: add `AND template_id = :template_id` to the lookup (the index then guarantees a single row), parse `template_id` off `ingress.ready`, thread it through orchestration and the `MAPPING_LOOKED_UP` audit, and decide the consumer's behaviour when a message carries no `template_id` (back-compat fallback vs hard error). **Hard gate:** no promote-to-ACTIVE path that can produce a second ACTIVE template under one source ships before Slice 8a lands.

**Owed-downstream gaps folded under this entry (8a scope or its immediate neighbours) — all closed.** (1) the consumer lookup fix above — CLOSED (Slice 8a, this resolution); (2) bronze `template_id` column added in Slice 8 so replay (Slice 12) can re-derive the template from `bronze_ref` rather than re-resolving — CLOSED (Slice 8, D73); (3) the `template_id`-absent contract policy — CLOSED (Slice 8a, D74: absent is unreachable at the lookup; the envelope contract-reject is the policy, no fallback exists).

**Cross-refs.** D54 (`csv.received` trigger + trust model), D68 (template grain), D69 (config RLS), D22 (`mapping_version_id` pin), Slice 8, Slice 10, Slice 12.


### D72 CSV upload Phase 1 is synchronous: the file streams through dis-ui-server to GCS in one request; no upload-session object, no signed PUT URL, no completion detection `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (Slice 8). Supersedes D36's signed-URL mechanic and closes D54's open completion fork.

**Decision.** `POST /api/v1/csv-uploads` on dis-ui-server receives the multipart CSV (`file` + `template_id` + `store_code`), enforces the 10 MB ceiling mid-stream, runs the tier-0 structural gate (D51), resolves identity once (tenant from the verified token, store from the mirror, source from the template lineage — D37 posture), writes the object to the canonical D53 path itself, and publishes `csv.received` — all in one synchronous request. The upload-session object, the signed PUT URL, and the completion-detection mechanic are removed entirely.

**What this supersedes and what stands.** D36's signed-URL mechanic (Phase-1 item 1: "returns a short-lived signed PUT URL") is superseded; D36's *placement* decision — Phase 1 inside dis-ui-server, the BFF rationale — stands and is what Slice 8 implements. D54's open "how does the server learn the PUT completed" fork is closed by removal: the server writes the object, so save-confirmation is the synchronous write return. D54's trust model (the worker reads identity and `trace_id` off the event and resolves nothing) stands unchanged.

**Why.** The 10 MB ceiling removes any large-file case for direct-to-GCS upload; streaming through the server is simpler (no session store, no URL expiry, no completion race) and puts the tier-0 gate and the size boundary where the bytes actually arrive. The ceiling is enforced as bytes cross it (the streaming guard is the boundary; `Content-Length` is only a spoofable first check) — proven at the ASGI seam, not just the reader unit.

**The `upload_session_id` field remains on the wire, deterministically derived.** `us_` + the first 12 lowercase-hex chars of SHA-256 over `tenant_id|store_id|template_id|payload_sha256`. Deterministic so a client retry of the same bytes re-derives the same id: the worker's D58 dedup key `(tenant, source_payload_id, payload_sha256)` fires across retries and the D65 id-less-source protection holds (one bronze row → one `ingress.ready` → no double-counted canonical events). Its "session object" meaning is retired; the field NAME is now historical (stale-wording, future contract-hygiene pass).

**Failure posture.** GCS-write-then-publish; a publish failure after the write returns 503 and leaves an accepted orphan object (unreferenced, no bronze row, no compensating delete — the deterministic retry converges without one). A 201 is returned only after the publish is broker-acked, so a client can never hold a 201 without a published event; the inverse window (event without 201, crash before the response) is absorbed by the same dedup.

**Cross-refs.** D36 (placement stands; mechanic superseded), D54 (fork closed; trust model stands), D58 (the dedup key this derivation feeds), D65 (the id-less protection retry-determinism preserves), D71 (the `template_id` the upload validates ACTIVE and carries). **Scope.** dis-ui-server `handlers/csv_uploads.py` + `upload_stream.py`/`tier0.py`/`publisher.py`/`audit.py`, the `csv.received` contract, Slice 8.


### D73 bronze persists `template_id` for replay lineage `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (Slice 8; the obligation was folded under D71 item 2).

**Decision.** `bronze.data_ingress_events` carries `template_id` (nullable `uuid`, no FK, no index — migration 0006), written by the csv-ingest-worker from the `csv.received` event. Slice 12 replay (`ingress.resubmit`) can therefore re-derive the template from `bronze_ref` rather than re-resolving it from long-gone request state.

**Why nullable, no FK.** Pre-Slice-8 rows genuinely have no template (history cannot be backfilled truthfully); `template_id` is not FK-addressable (`config.source_mappings` is keyed by `mapping_version_id`; the template id repeats across a lineage's version rows), and bronze deliberately does not enforce on config tables (the `mapping_version_id` precedent). The contract requires the field on every event since Slice 8, so new rows always carry it. The worker's resume-and-mark re-publish takes `template_id` off the incoming event, never off bronze — a pre-0006 NULL row can never wedge the publish (test-pinned).

**Cross-refs.** D71 (the carry this completes the persistence leg of), D54 (the event the value arrives on), Slice 12 (the replay consumer). **Scope.** Migration 0006, the bronze manifest, `csv_ingest_worker/bronze.py` + `pipeline.py`.


### D74 `template_id`-absent on `ingress.ready` is a contract violation, terminally acked at the envelope; no consumer fallback exists `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (Slice 8a, registered in plan mode, number assigned at the commit gate). Closes D71's open item (3).

**Decision.** A message without `template_id` on `ingress.ready` is a contract violation, terminally acked at the envelope parse before the template-keyed lookup; no consumer fallback exists; recovery is Slice 12 replay from bronze (D73). Mechanically: the field is required by the frozen contract (Slice 8) and the consumer's envelope model carries it with no default, so an absent or malformed value fails `parse_ingress_ready` (`EventContractError`) and the subscriber ACKs the message as terminal (the one sanctioned ack-on-failure: identity unknowable, redelivery identical) — before any pipeline stage runs. No single-ACTIVE fallback or any other consumer fallback exists, by decision rather than omission: the envelope contract-reject IS the policy.

**Reachability, assessed at 8a.** Structurally unreachable at the lookup. A pre-Slice-8 in-flight message could only exist in a producer/consumer rollout window — none exists (no cloud deployment; Slices 8 and 8a both precede production traffic), and even then the behaviour is defined and safe (contract-reject → terminal ack; bronze remains the recoverable source, D5; Slice 12 replay re-derives `template_id` from the bronze row, D73). Any future non-CSV producer (api, csv_erp, reverse_api) is bound by the frozen contract (hard rule 10) and a non-conforming one hits the same reject. Test-pinned: the envelope required-field reject (absent key → `EventContractError`) and the model-vs-contract required-set drift guard.

**Cross-refs.** D71 (the open item this closes), D73 (the bronze lineage replay recovers from), D54 (the trust model: the consumer reads identity off the event, resolves nothing), Slice 12 (the replay consumer). **Scope.** No code — the policy is the pre-existing envelope reject; this entry records that no fallback exists by decision.

### D75 Template-grain ripple beyond Slices 8/8a: four sites carry single-template assumptions, folded into the promote/reject/shadow slice `OPEN`

**Status.** `OPEN` (registered from a read-only blast-radius investigation after 8a). The template grain (D68) and multiple ACTIVE templates per source ripple beyond the upload carry (D73), the bronze column (D73), and the consumer lookup (D71/8a). A full sweep of the repo + live DB (5433) confirms the framing premise holds — `mapping_version_id` is the global BIGSERIAL PK (FK'd from canonical ×3, staging ×3, quarantine), so canonical/audit rows already identify the template transitively and need NO `template_id` column. The genuine residue is four single-template assumptions; only one is reachable today, and no production path can create a second ACTIVE template yet (dis-ui-server writes only DRAFTs; only the promote/reject/shadow slice, unbuilt, will activate a second).

**The four sites (bucket A — break or mislead).**
- **A1 (the load-bearing one, promote prerequisite).** `contracts/pubsub/mapping.changed.schema.json` encodes single-template grain: no `template_id` field (`additionalProperties:false` blocks adding one without a contract edit), `mapping_version_id` described as "monotonically increasing per (tenant, source)" (false once two lineages interleave on the global serial), and `previous_active_version_id` undefined at template grain. Not reachable today (zero publishers/consumers; the publish is deferred). The promote slice is exactly what publishes it, so it MUST be revised (add `template_id`, fix the three stale descriptions) before/within promote, per hard rule 10.
- **A2 (reachable today, cosmetic).** `config.source_mappings_v` computes `label = tenant-source-v{version_seq}-{date}`; `version_seq_per_source` is per-template since 0005, so two templates under one source both render `v1` → identical labels, with no view column to disambiguate (two DRAFTs suffice; no second ACTIVE needed). Mitigating: NO code consumes the view (only migration 0005 + tests) — it misleads ops, never corrupts data. This is the D68-registered view-label gap, now confirmed cosmetic. (Cheap fix: surface `template_id`/`template_name` in the view.)
- **A3 (test-infra, promote prerequisite).** `libs/dis-testing/seed.py` gates its fixture INSERT on "any ACTIVE for (tenant, source)" — template-blind, the same assumption class 8a fixed. A second template's ACTIVE row makes the seeder skip the default → downstream "no ACTIVE mapping for template_id" failures. Will trip the promote slice's own integration tests; template-key the check there.
- **A4 (vestigial, comment-only).** `bronze.data_ingress_events.mapping_version_id` is unwritten (the worker omits it) but its comment still asserts single-active "looked up by the receiver" semantics. Misleads schema readers; zero executing code. Correct the comment (or decide the column's fate) when convenient.

**Observability gaps (bucket B — work, lose template grouping; scheduled, not gated).** Audit (`audit.events` carries `template_id` only in `MAPPING_LOOKED_UP` event_data; recoverable by a `config.source_mappings` join not currently written) and quarantine (recoverable by the FK / two-hop-via-bronze joins, both in schema). **B2 is the largest:** no BigQuery table carries `template_id` and `config.source_mappings` has no BQ export, so per-template grouping is impossible in-warehouse — needs a dimension export, a Phase-3 / dbt-buildout item, not a bug.

**Confirmed fine (bucket C).** The consumer lookup (8a), upload gate, mapping CRUD + EXCLUDE, version-seq trigger, canonical stamping, all FKs, and the dedup keys (D33/D58/D65) are template-agnostic or transitively template-aware — D58 idempotency is template-aware through the `upload_session_id` hash (D72). One operator-level edge noted, not a key change: two ACTIVE sale-shaped templates under one source with overlapping unrelated `transaction_id` namespaces could cross-collapse at D33 dedup — an onboarding/operator-docs note for the promote slice, not a dedup-key fix.

**Decision.** No standalone fix slice. The promote/reject/shadow slice (now unblocked by 8a/D71) carries the prerequisites — A1 (revise `mapping.changed`) and A3 (template-key the seeder) are in-scope blockers for it; A2 and A4 are cheap schema-touch fold-ins; B2 and the C `transaction_id`-namespace note are scheduled/documented, not gated. Nothing here is reachable in a way that corrupts data today (A2's label is cosmetic and unconsumed), so no action before the promote slice.

**Cross-refs.** D68 (template grain), D71/D74 (consumer lookup, 8a), D72/D73 (upload carry, bronze), D33/D58/D65 (dedup keys, confirmed template-correct), the D68 view-label gap (A2), the promote/reject/shadow slice (owner of A1+A3, fold-in of A2+A4). **Hard rule 10** governs the A1 contract revision.

### D76 DIS has no platform/operator see-all; cross-tenant reads are deferred to the first ops-read slice `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (Slice 17b realized this — see D91/D92/D93; originally registered `OPEN` while noting the DIS UI serves both tenant and Ithina-operator users). At registration, DIS RLS was single-GUC: every policy was `tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')`. There is no `app.user_type`, no PLATFORM OR-branch, no see-all. The 13a auth seam distinguishes `require_tenant` vs `require_ops` at the HTTP layer, but that stops at the door — it does not translate into any cross-tenant DB read.

**Why deferred (not a defect).** Every DIS data path has been tenant-scoped, so the two-GUC see-all machinery would have been speculative; 13a and 14b both scoped it out, naming "the first ops-read slice" as the trigger. The two-GUC `app.user_type` pattern exists in DIS only in the test harness modelling Customer Master's DB, not on DIS's own tables.

**When it bites + the build.** The DIS UI is used by Ithina operators as well as tenants, so the first operator feature that reads across tenants (ops quarantine console, cross-tenant audit, an ops dashboard) needs this. The build is two parts: (1) a `dis-rls` variant that sets `app.user_type`; (2) a policy migration adding the PLATFORM OR-branch to every DIS tenant-scoped table. Not a config flag — it touches the RLS lib and migrates every policy. Customer Master already has this exact pattern (frozen two-GUC `AuthContext` + policy OR-branch); the slice ports it, not invents it.

**Not to be conflated.** `identity_mirror` is RLS-OFF entirely (D41) because it is shared reference data everything FKs against — openly cross-tenant by design, a different thing from a see-all capability (and the reason 14b's store endpoint scopes in-query, the D70 weak link). The DIS tenant tables are strictly single-tenant with no see-all yet.

**Decision.** Single-GUC stood for v1; Slice 17b built the two-GUC PLATFORM see-all (D91) + impersonation-write (D92), porting Customer Master's pattern but ASYMMETRICALLY (PLATFORM in USING only, never WITH CHECK). **Cross-refs.** D41, D69, D70, D91, D92, D93, Slice 13a, Slice 14b, Slice 17b.

### D77 audit.events de-partitioned to a plain table for beta — the D45 silent write-cliff removed `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (Slice 30a). `audit.events` is now a plain (non-partitioned) table; a write for ANY `event_date` lands with no missing-partition error.

**Decision.** `audit.events` is de-partitioned for beta to remove the D45 silent write-cliff (range partitions with a fixed bootstrap-only window, no DEFAULT partition, no automation; out-of-range writes swallowed by fire-and-forget). Migration 0007 drops the partitioned table and recreates it plain by re-applying `schemas/postgres/audit/events.sql` verbatim (the 0001 manifest pattern; rows were disposable storm junk, operator-confirmed, no preservation). The one-tuple removal of `("audit", "events", "event_date")` from 0001's `PARTITIONED` list makes a fresh bootstrap plain too — **fresh == migrated**, proven by scratch-DB catalog equality (`tests/integration/test_migration_0007.py::test_fresh_bootstrap_converges_with_delta_path`) on top of the by-construction argument (both paths apply the same DDL file at the same chain position).

**Shape changes.** PK `(id, event_date)` → `(id)` (the composite existed only to satisfy the partition-key-in-PK requirement; `id` is uuidv7, hard rule 3). `event_date` STAYS a NOT NULL column. `ck_audit_events_event_date_matches` is **KEPT** — not a partition-routing-only artifact: it defines the column's semantics (`event_date` = UTC date of `event_timestamp`, which the `dis-audit` model derives) and is the invariant Slice 21 relies on when it re-partitions by `event_date`. All other constraints, the FK to `identity_mirror.tenants`, the five secondary indexes, FORCE RLS and the tenant policy are unchanged; the writer needed no code change.

**Scope.** `audit.events` ONLY. The 6 other partitioned parents (canonical/staging event + signal_history tables) keep their partitioning — they are the D29/D34 eviction substrate and fail LOUD (batch nack) on a missing partition, so they carry no silent-loss risk; test-pinned (`test_scope_boundary_no_other_parent_departitioned`). Partitioning for `audit.events`, WITH automation, is re-introduced at Slice 21 (BQ archive + eviction), the slice that actually needs it. **[Scope clause REVISED by D85: the 6 parents were subsequently de-partitioned too, on the same disposable-rows pattern; the boundary test moved to `test_migration_0009.py`, inverted.]**

**Forward note.** The writer's fire-and-forget log wording still names "a missing partition" as an alert-worthy cause (`libs/dis-audit/src/dis_audit/postgres_writer.py:90`) — now historical, left per the slice's no-writer-change rule; tidy at the next writer-touching slice. **Cross-refs.** D45 (the gap, now RESOLVED-for-beta), D29/D34 (the 35-day buffer + BQ archive that re-partition at Slice 21), D43/D44 (writer posture, unchanged), hard rule 11.

### D78 The failure-audit shape — the contract the quarantine work consumes `SETTLED`

**Status.** `SETTLED` (Slice 30b). The set of columns a FAILURE audit row carries, defined and test-enforced (mutation-killed, not incidental).

**The shape.** Every FAILURE row carries `trace_id` + `tenant_id` ALWAYS (D43); `data_ingress_event_id` on every post-bronze failure; `mapping_version_id` on every post-lookup failure; a stable `failure_code` (the D79 `FailureCode` enum); `failure_message`; `duration_ms` on INGRESS_EVENT-scoped rows (the lap-timer stage span — ROW-scoped records are not stages and carry none). ROW-scoped validation failures add `row_offset` + `event_data.check` (the pandera check name; an unbounded vocabulary, so never enum members). dis-ui-server rows (including the formerly-silent 4xx family: multipart 400/413, tier-0 422, template 404/409, store 404/409) add `auth_principal` + `client_ip`. The consumer catch-all threads its known ids via a per-call flow context (`orchestrate.py` `_FlowContext`, assigned post-fetch / post-lookup) — the de-partition precursor's storm shape (~792K FAILURE rows with the load-bearing id buried in `failure_message`) is no longer producible, and a mutation test enforces it.

**The contract.** A held/quarantined row joins its audit story by `trace_id` (the spine); its chunk by `data_ingress_event_id`; its template by `mapping_version_id → config.source_mappings`. A FAILURE row never buries an id it knows in `failure_message`.

**Structurally-NULL exceptions (correct, not gaps).** dis-ui-server rows carry no `data_ingress_event_id` (no bronze exists in that service); worker path-mismatch and PII-block rows carry none (both pre-bronze — the PII gate runs BEFORE the bronze write per hard rule 2, so the 30b slice-doc line "the bronze row exists and the id is known" on the PII path was WRONG and is corrected here: the detected-column COUNT rides `event_data`, `bronze_id` stays NULL). The unparseable envelope stays silent-by-design (tenant unknowable, D43).

**Forward.** `prior_trace_id` and the `DUPLICATE_NOOP`/`DUPLICATE_OVERWRITTEN` outcomes join the seam in Slice 30c (the D42 revision — duplicates still emit the D42 `event_data` JSONB shape as of this slice). `RETRIED` on consumer redelivery is emitted via a best-effort fire-and-forget audit readback (degrades to SUCCESS on failure, never wedges — test-proven at the pipeline level); Pub/Sub `delivery_attempt` replaces it once the quarantine work's DLQ lands. **Cross-refs.** D79 (the vocabulary), D34 (Phase-1 sink), D33 (the duplicate audit), D63 (the HOT_POSITION_MISSING disposition), D43/D44, hard rule 11.

### D79 The FailureCode vocabulary — a closed enum replaces exception-class-name failure codes `SETTLED`

**Status.** `SETTLED` (Slice 30b). `audit.events.failure_code` was an unstable mix — exception class names (the consumer catch-all), per-site strings (`path_mismatch`, `gcs_write_failed`), raw reason codes (`not_csv`), stage names, pandera check names — which defeats "all X failures" queries.

**Decision.** `FailureCode`, a closed 27-member `StrEnum` owned by `dis-audit` (`failure_codes.py`): 12 dis-ui-server members (the upload 4xx family + GCS/publish), 6 worker members (path-mismatch, the 4 prefixed preflight reasons, PII), 8 consumer members (contract/mapping-config/suite-ref, the 3 gate summaries, `VALIDATION_ROW_FAILED`, the D63 `HOT_POSITION_MISSING` — backed by a dedicated `HotPositionMissingError` in dis-core so it no longer raises a bare `DisError`), plus the `INFRA_FAILURE` fallback. `failure_code_for(exc)` maps the dis-core error types; service-local codes map at their emit sites (step-disambiguated for the two `ResourceNotFoundError` sources). **No-information-loss rule:** every prior value maps to a member; unmapped exception classes fall to `INFRA_FAILURE` with `event_data["exception_class"]` preserving the class name; raw reasons/check names ride `event_data`.

**Zero DDL.** Like `Stage`, closure is a TYPE-LEVEL guarantee: the live `failure_code` is a CHECK-less `varchar(64)` (member width unit-pinned ≤64); the enum is a `StrEnum`, so the member IS the wire string and the writer/schema are untouched. **Cross-refs.** D78 (the shape this vocabulary serves), D42 (the duplicate-detail representation, revised separately in 30c).

### D80 D42 REVISED: the duplicate detail is promoted from event_data JSONB to first-class columns `SETTLED`

**Status.** `SETTLED` (Slice 30c). A conscious REVISION of D42, not a fix: D42 was RESOLVED by Slice 10 via a deliberate choice — the duplicate detail (`DUPLICATE_NOOP`/`DUPLICATE_OVERWRITTEN`, `prior_trace_id`, `row_hash`, `dedup_key`) lived in `event_data` JSONB within the then-4-value outcome CHECK; promotion was "rejected as over-engineering for v1.0" (the Slice-10 register note under D42). That resolution is superseded here with a reason: **the audit and quarantine consoles query by these fields** — "duplicate rate per tenant" and "what redelivered from what" become column queries instead of JSONB digs.

**Decision.** `DUPLICATE_NOOP` and `DUPLICATE_OVERWRITTEN` are first-class `outcome` values (the live CHECK extends 4 → 6) and `prior_trace_id` is a live column (uuid, NULL on non-duplicate rows). **Only the queried-by fields are promoted**: `row_hash` and `dedup_key` (store_id/source_id/source_event_id) remain in `event_data`. **Semantics unchanged (D33):** the DUPLICATE_* pair REFINES SUCCESS — the append-only insert genuinely landed; they are not failures. Emit sites: the consumer's dedup-hit event sets `outcome=Outcome(hit.kind)` (the `DuplicateKind` kind strings are exactly the enum values) + the column; the worker's dedup no-op sets `DUPLICATE_NOOP` + the column (formerly SKIPPED + JSONB); the worker's resume-publish is `RETRIED` (a retry-completion made legible). The old JSONB keys are dropped, not duplicated — mutation-test-enforced (reverting either the outcome or the column promotion fails the flipped duplicate test).

**Migration 0008** (additive on the plain 30a table — real rows, never drop-recreate): existence-gated `ADD COLUMN` + definition-gated CHECK swap, a TRUE NO-OP on a manifest-fresh database (gate-firing proven by a stamp-rerun test, not result-matching); fresh == migrated by scratch-DB catalog equality. **The downgrade refuses loudly** when DUPLICATE_* rows exist — named message + count, the rows untouched by the refused attempt (assertion-pinned after the adversarial pass found the original test passing on alembic's banner text). `prior_trace_id` joins the D78 failure-audit seam. **Cross-refs.** D42 (revised), D33 (semantics), D78 (the seam), D77 (the plain table this is additive on), D44, Slice 10 (the superseded resolution).

### D81 The dis-audit drift guard checks type/nullability/length, fail-loud — not just column names `SETTLED`

**Status.** `SETTLED` (Slice 30c; its own entry — a different concern from D80's queryability revision). The model-vs-schema drift guard was a column-NAME-set match (both directions) only: a type narrowing (`varchar(64)` → `varchar(32)`) or a nullability flip passed the guard and surfaced only as a runtime INSERT failure — which the fire-and-forget writer swallows. That is the **D45 silent-loss class**: the audit trail stops recording and nothing fails loud.

**Decision.** `dis-audit` owns a frozen schema contract (`schema_contract.py`: `EXPECTED_COLUMNS`, 24 per-column specs in `information_schema` vocabulary — data_type, is_nullable, character_maximum_length; ordinals deliberately excluded, the fresh-vs-migrate equality is name-keyed) and a PURE `diff_schema(live_rows, expected)` returning human-readable diffs. The integration guard feeds it the REAL `information_schema.columns` rows and asserts zero diffs; a unit pin ties `AuditEvent.db_column_names() == EXPECTED_COLUMNS.keys()` so model ↔ contract ↔ live agree transitively. **Narrowing-proven without DB mutation**: unit tests synthesize live-shaped rows from the contract and tamper one axis at a time — a varchar narrowing, a type change, a nullability flip, and missing/extra columns are each reported. Schema drift now fails loud at the guard, not silently at INSERT. **Cross-refs.** D45 (the silent-loss class this closes a slice of), D80 (the same-commit schema change this guard now covers), D43/D44 (writer posture, unchanged).

### D82 The quarantine storm-stopper: deterministic failure → direct quarantine write → ACK `SETTLED`

**Status.** `SETTLED` (Slice 11a). Pre-11a, a deterministic failure (the empty/invalid-ACTIVE-mapping that caused the local storm) was nacked with `ack_deadline_seconds=0`, so Pub/Sub redelivered it forever — one FAILURE audit row per cycle, nothing ever set aside.

**Decision.** The streaming-consumer recognizes a NARROW ALLOWLIST of known-deterministic failures, writes them DIRECTLY to the existing `quarantine.*` tables — a new `libs/dis-quarantine` owns the fail-loud write path; chunk-level → `quarantined_chunks`, row-level → `quarantined_rows`, `status=NEW` only (lifecycle transitions and replay are later slices; the record models cannot express a transition at all) — emits the reserved `QUARANTINED` audit stage (`Outcome.SUCCESS`, the DISPOSITION record: the FAILURE row already recorded the failure, so the trail reads "failed at stage X → QUARANTINED", carrying the D78 shape), and ACKS so the message leaves the queue — breaking the storm at its source.

**The governing principle.** A failure is quarantinable only if retrying genuinely CANNOT help. A failure waiting for a dependency to arrive (catalogue/position onboarding → `HOT_POSITION_MISSING`; mirror-sync lag → the `CONTRACT_VIOLATION` store-miss case) is NOT deterministic in this sense — retry is its designed recovery — so it keeps nacking (self-heals) until replay exists.

**The allowlist.** `MAPPING_CONFIG_INVALID`, `SUITE_REF_UNSUPPORTED`, guarded `CONTRACT_VIOLATION` (`dis_channel` known AND `field != "store_id"` — the known-columns guard makes every pre-fetch failure non-quarantinable; the store-miss carve-out applies the governing principle) → chunk; `VALIDATION_ROW_FAILED` → rows where `row_index` is known / chunk where `row_index` is None (the row-less shape carries the gate-summary code — `PRE/POST_VALIDATION_FAILED`, `MAPPING_EXECUTION_FAILED` — as `failure_reason`). Everything else (`INFRA_FAILURE`, all transients) keeps audit-and-nack; the Pub/Sub dead-letter policy backstops. The allowlist is pinned verbatim by a truth-table unit test on the guard (`test_quarantine_allowlist.py`) — the adversarial pass found the store-miss carve-out otherwise unenforced (the behavioral nack was an accidental `fk_qc_store`-violation rescue, not the carve-out); widening is a conscious future decision, never a drive-by edit.

**The write-failure asymmetry.** Audit = the RECORD of what happened = fire-and-forget (hard rule 11, unchanged); quarantine = the HELD THING itself = fail-loud (`QuarantineWriteError`, dis-core). A failed hold NACKS — never ack-and-lose — and the ordering is load-bearing: quarantine-write-loud → QUARANTINED-audit-emit-forget → ack. A failed audit emit never blocks the ack of a successfully-held chunk; an unheld chunk leaves no disposition trail. Good rows of a held chunk are NOT written (the whole-chunk processing model is unchanged — no partial success exists; bronze is the recoverable source for the future replay).

**Architecture.** Direct write (11a, operator-decided): the consumer writes the store and acks. The `quarantine` topic + drainer (the original topic-mediated Slice 11 design) is Slice 11b — not built here; the frozen `quarantine.schema.json` contract and the docs-only `services/quarantine-drainer/` await it. **Zero schema change**: the live tables sufficed; `row_sha256` stays NULL by design (no row hash exists at gate time). **DDL-header drift recorded, not patched**: the headers attribute writes to the 11b drainer and describe an "otherwise-successful chunk" partial-success rows model that does not exist — a `quarantined_rows` entry currently means "held because these rows failed; siblings unwritten, recoverable from bronze". **Known test-emulator flake** (not a production-code issue): a drain-vs-deadline-0-redelivery race on the shared test subscription, twice observed and unreproduced in 7+ subsequent full runs, defended by per-trace assertions and an at-least-once-tolerant no-sustained-redelivery form. **Cross-refs.** D78 (the shape both records carry), D79 (the stable `failure_reason` vocabulary), D63 (the excluded self-heal miss), D43/D44 (audit posture, unchanged), hard rule 11.

### D83: Cloud-wiring posture (Slice 40a). The four Pub/Sub clients (dis-ui-server publisher,
csv-ingest-worker publisher + subscriber, streaming-consumer subscriber) use emulator-or-ambient:
emulator when PUBSUB_EMULATOR_HOST is set, real GCP via ambient service-account credentials when
not, mirroring dis-storage. The pre-40a emulator-required guard (a deliberate "cloud wiring
deferred" raise) is removed; the pubsub_v1 clients self-honor the emulator var so both branches
construct identically. The two pull-loop workers (csv-ingest-worker, streaming-consumer) run a
readiness /healthz HTTP server (uvicorn + raw ASGI) behind a runtime env-var toggle
(RUN_HEALTH_SERVER) around an unchanged core loop: toggle on = healthz + loop as sibling asyncio
tasks under one event loop (Cloud Run Service mode); toggle off/unset = the verbatim pure loop
(local dev, and future Cloud Run Worker Pools, the switch is config-only, no app change). Readiness
not liveness: the loop writes a heartbeat each cycle UNCONDITIONALLY, /healthz returns 200 if fresh
(within HEALTH_STALENESS_SECONDS=60) and 503 if stale, so a dead loop (HTTP up, loop crashed) is
restarted by Cloud Run, closing the zombie-worker silent stall. mirror-sync-consumer (DB pull job,
no Pub/Sub) is untouched. Infra is out (Amit): the health-check contract (port $PORT, GET /healthz,
readiness), csv-ingest-worker max-instances=1 as a CORRECTNESS constraint (D58 query-dedup is
single-instance only), and the new pubsub.subscriptions.get IAM requirement (the subscribers'
_require_subscription now runs against real GCP). Cross-refs D58.

### D84 Post-fetch CONTRACT_VIOLATION was misclassified as pre-fetch — the parse-stage hold gap closed `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (this batch). Found by driving the D82 allowlist's unit-proven dispositions through the live pipeline to the actual quarantine write and ack.

**The defect.** `_quarantinable`'s known-columns guard (D82: every pre-fetch failure is non-quarantinable — `quarantined_chunks.dis_channel` is NOT NULL) keys on the flow context's `dis_channel`, but the context learned it only AFTER `fetch_chunk` returned, while `parse_chunk` runs INSIDE the fetch stage — after the bronze row carrying `dis_channel` was already read. An unparseable bronze object — and its twin, the zero-data-rows chunk — raised the guarded post-fetch `CONTRACT_VIOLATION` with the context still empty, so the guard misread a genuinely post-fetch deterministic failure as pre-fetch, refused the hold, and the chunk nacked forever: the exact redeliver storm D82 was built to stop, alive on one allowlist member.

**The fix.** `fetch_chunk` reports the bronze row the moment it is read via an `on_bronze` hook (`pipeline/fetch.py`), and the orchestrator's `_FlowContext.note_bronze` records `bronze_id`/`dis_channel` mid-stage (`orchestrate.py`) — the partially-acquired fetch context no longer dies with the exception. The allowlist set, the guard's three gates, and the ack/nack routing are UNCHANGED: pre-fetch failures (absent bronze row) still carry no `dis_channel` and still nack; the store-miss carve-out still nacks (re-proven in the same run).

**Regression proof.** `services/streaming-consumer/tests/integration/test_quarantine_disposition.py` — `test_unparseable_bronze_object_quarantines_chunk_and_acks` + `test_empty_bronze_chunk_quarantines_chunk_and_acks` (the fixed pair), landed alongside end-to-end pins for the two other dispositions that were unit-only: `test_suite_ref_unsupported_quarantines_chunk_and_acks`, `test_post_gate_null_mandatory_holds_rows_and_acks`.

**Cross-refs.** D82 (the storm-stopper allowlist and the known-columns guard's intent), D78 (the failure-audit shape the held records carry), D79 (the `CONTRACT_VIOLATION` vocabulary), Slice 11a (`docs/slices/slice-11a-quarantine-storm-stopper.md`).

### D85 The six canonical/staging parents de-partitioned to plain tables for beta — D77's scope clause revised `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (migration 0009). A conscious REVISION of D77's scope clause, not a fix: D77 de-partitioned `audit.events` ONLY and explicitly KEPT the 6 other partitioned parents — canonical `{store_sku_sale_events, store_sku_change_events, store_sku_signal_history}` and the staging mirrors — because they fail LOUD (batch nack) on a missing partition, so they carried no silent-loss risk (test-pinned by `test_scope_boundary_no_other_parent_departitioned`). That boundary is repealed here with a reason: the same fixed bootstrap-only window (0001, `CURRENT_DATE-1..+5`, no DEFAULT partition, no automation) sits under all six, so past the window EVERY consumer batch nacks — loud, but a hard ingest outage on a calendar date, with no partition manager arriving before Slice 21. Removal, not automation, is the beta posture, exactly as D77.

**Decision.** All 6 parents are de-partitioned for beta. Migration 0009 drops each partitioned parent (children drop with it; rows in all six were disposable in BOTH local and Cloud SQL, operator-confirmed, no preservation; nothing FK-references any of the six — live-introspected) and recreates it plain by re-applying its `schemas/postgres/{canonical,staging}/*.sql` DDL file verbatim (the 0001/0007 manifest pattern). Emptying 0001's `PARTITIONED` list makes a fresh bootstrap plain too — **fresh == migrated**, proven by scratch-DB catalog equality (`tests/integration/test_migration_0009.py::test_fresh_bootstrap_converges_with_delta_path`) on top of the by-construction argument. The downgrade recreates the frozen pre-0009 partitioned shapes (inlined in the migration from the pre-edit DDL files at git HEAD, cross-checked against the live catalog) with FRESH `CURRENT_DATE`-relative 7-day windows; rows are not preserved in either direction.

**Shape changes (the D77 PK precedent, applied six-fold).** PKs `(id, event_date)` / `(id, as_of_date)` → `(id)` — the composites existed only to satisfy the partition-key-in-PK requirement; `id` is uuidv7 (hard rule 3). `event_date` / `as_of_date` STAY NOT NULL columns; the derivation CHECKs (`ck_*_event_date_matches_*`) are **KEPT** — they define the columns' semantics and are the invariants Slice 21 relies on when it re-partitions. The signal_history natural keys (`uq_sssh_natural` / `uq_st_sssh_natural`) keep `as_of_date`: the daily-snapshot grain, not a partition artifact (and signal_history is daily-compute output, not an event table, so hard rule 7 does not bar them). All other constraints, FKs, secondary indexes, triggers, FORCE RLS and the tenant policies are unchanged; the streaming consumer and daily-compute need no code change (their statements target the parent tables; partitioning was transparent).

**Scope.** The six parents ONLY. `audit.events` stays plain (D77/0007 untouched); the hot tables (`store_sku_current_position`, both schemas), bronze, and quarantine are untouched — test-pinned by the INVERTED boundary (`test_migration_0009.py::test_scope_boundary_nothing_else_moved`; the 30a boundary test it replaces is retired with its slice's repealed clause).

**Forward notes.**
- **Slice 21 now re-partitions ALL 7 tables** (the six + `audit.events`), WITH automation, as one coherent piece (BQ archive + eviction).
- **D29 is impacted:** its "Schema-side implication: None — the canonical event tables already partition by event_date" no longer holds. Slice 21 must re-partition before partition-drop eviction can run (or adopt DELETE-based eviction); settle there. D34's audit archive plan is unchanged in substance. D30's "mitigated by partitioning events by date" tradeoff note is weakened until Slice 21.
- **Historical wording left in place per the no-consumer-change rule** (the D77 forward-note precedent): `services/streaming-consumer/src/streaming_consumer/sinks/canonical.py:37-42` ("a missing event_date partition errors loudly") and the `services/streaming-consumer/CLAUDE.md` invariant line "Missing event-date partition fails loud" — both now describe an unreachable case (the loud-error/rollback/nack posture for the CHECK/infra class is unchanged and still load-bearing); tidy at the next consumer-touching slice.

**Cross-refs.** D77 (the precedent and the revised scope clause), D45 (the original cliff analysis), D29/D34 (the buffer + archive that re-partition at Slice 21), D30/D31/D33 (write/compute/dedup semantics, unchanged), D22 (mapping version pinning, unchanged), hard rule 7.

### D86 `store_code` removed from the template-mapping-fields catalog — store identity is receiver-resolved, not column-mapped `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (Slice 14d). A catalog correction, not a behaviour change: nothing consumed the removed field.

**The decision.** The functional `store_code` field is removed from the catalog entirely (it appeared only on the `snapshot` field set). Store identity is resolved at the upload receiver — the multipart form field `store_code` is resolved to the internal `store_id` (`services/dis-ui-server/src/dis_ui_server/handlers/csv_uploads.py:215` via `repos/stores.py:43` `resolve_store_by_code`) and carried on the `ingress.ready` envelope; the streaming consumer reads `store_id` off the envelope and never re-resolves or mints it. A CSV column is therefore never mapped to a store, and the create/edit mapping validator already 400s any rule that targets `store_code` (it is not a `mapping_produced` column of `StoreSkuCurrentPosition` — `mapping_validation.py:176`). The catalog field was thus a label with no path behind it: advertising it as mappable was misleading and contradicted the validator.

**Deferred (its own designed slice).** Per-row / multi-store store assignment — the case where one uploaded file spans multiple stores — is NOT addressed here. **Open question:** where store identity comes from when a single file covers multiple stores (a mapped per-row store column resolved against the identity mirror, a per-file constraint, or a different ingress shape). To be designed as a dedicated slice; until then the receiver's one-store-per-upload model (form field → `store_id` → envelope) stands.

**Scope.** dis-ui-server catalog only. The `_STORE_CODE_FIELD` object and its snapshot append are deleted (`catalog/field_catalog.py`); the now-unused `"store"` `FieldSection` member is dropped (`schemas/mapping_fields.py`). The receiver's `store_code` form field, `resolve_store_by_code`, the envelope `store_code` readability field, and all consumer store handling are UNCHANGED.

**Cross-refs.** D53 (canonical GCS path / internal tenant UUID), D54 (receiver trust boundary, `trace_id`/identity read off the envelope), D37/D58 (store resolution at upload), hard rule 4. Companion catalog change in the same batch: `__ignore__` extended to all three field sets, with its enforcement deferred (D87).

### D87 `__ignore__` offered on all three field sets, but source-column-assignment enforcement deferred `DEFERRED`

**Status.** `DEFERRED` (Slice 14d). The mistake-proofing TARGET ships; the GUARD that would make it load-bearing does not.

**The decision.** The `__ignore__` sentinel — previously on the `snapshot` set only — is now appended to all three `template_type` field sets (`sales` / `inventory_change` / `snapshot`) at one inclusion point (`catalog/field_catalog.py` `build_field_catalogs`), so a tenant can explicitly assign any unwanted source column to it on every template kind. **No enforcement was added**: nothing requires a source column to be assigned to a field or to `__ignore__`. Assigning a column to `__ignore__` is functionally identical to leaving it unmapped today — both are silently dropped by the mapping engine (`libs/dis-mapping/.../engine/rename.py:3`, which selects only declared rename targets); the create/edit validator (`mapping_validation.py`) checks only target legality + mandatory canonical coverage + presence pairings, never source-column coverage. So the target exists; the guard does not.

**Deferred (its own slice).** A "every source column must be assigned (to a field or `__ignore__`)" rule spanning the create/edit validator AND the `dis-mapping` rename-drop behaviour. **Trigger:** before tenants self-serve mapping, where a silently dropped column is real data-loss risk (today mappings are hand-authored / operator-reviewed, so the silent drop is contained).

**Cross-refs.** D86 (the same-batch catalogue revision), D49 (the `mapping_rules` shape the validator gates), Slice 14d.
### D88 Mapping-template creation is CREATE-AS-ACTIVE (reverses create-as-DRAFT) `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED`. Reverses the create-as-DRAFT decision recorded in `docs/slices/mapping-template-create-promote-decisions.md` (decision a, previously "LOCKED"). Go-live should produce an immediately-live mapping in one step, so the UI drops the draft -> activate ceremony while the ingest pipeline (which keys on ACTIVE) keeps working.

**Decision.** `POST /api/v1/mapping-templates` writes the lineage's v1 version with `status='ACTIVE'` and `activated_at` stamped, in one atomic insert (`repos/mapping_templates.py create_template`); the create response carries `active_version=1` (no DRAFT). The dis-ui go-live shows "Created and live" and no longer calls a separate `/activate` endpoint (the provisional honest-pending promote path is removed; `promoteMappingTemplate` deleted from the frontend). Edit (PATCH) still writes DRAFT (the D17 lifecycle for changes, unchanged).

**Why it is safe.** (1) **No supersede needed for create:** create mints a FRESH `template_id`, so the partial unique `uq_csm_active_per_source` (`(tenant_id, source_id, template_id) WHERE status='ACTIVE'`) cannot collide and no prior ACTIVE for that template can exist; at most one ACTIVE per template is preserved by construction. (2) **No `mapping.changed` needed:** the streaming consumer selects the active mapping per-chunk with a fresh keyed SELECT and no cache (`streaming-consumer/pipeline/mapping.py`; `mapping.changed`/D6 side-input refresh is DEFERRED), so the next batch sees the committed ACTIVE immediately. (3) **Single atomic insert**, no new transaction. (4) The `ck_csm_activated_at` CHECK (ACTIVE requires non-null `activated_at`) is satisfied by stamping `activated_at=func.now()`.

**Tradeoff (accepted for beta).** The D17 STAGED shadow-rollout (validate a new version in shadow against live traffic before activating) is BYPASSED for the create path: a created mapping goes straight to production. Accepted for beta; the shadow path remains available for the future promote/edit lifecycle.

**MANDATORY for any future activate-new-version-in-an-existing-lineage path** (not built here): it MUST deprecate the prior ACTIVE in the same transaction (supersede) to keep the partial unique satisfied, and (once the consumer adopts a cached side-input, D6) publish `mapping.changed`.

**Cross-refs.** `docs/slices/mapping-template-create-promote-decisions.md` (decision a/d reversed), D17 (shadow rollout, bypassed for create), D22 (version pinning, unchanged), D68 (template grain), D71 (template-keyed consumer), hard rule 7. Note: D86/D87 in the same register are Sanjeev's Slice-14d catalogue decisions, unrelated to this create-as-ACTIVE decision (originally drafted as D86, renumbered to D88 on rebase to avoid the clash).

### D89 Create-template contract redesign — semantic per-column request, sink re-derived from `template_type` + `dest_key`; endpoint verb-rename dropped `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (Slice 16a). The request CONTRACT and its shape gate ship in 16a; the translation-to-`mapping_rules` and persistence behind it are 16c, the new ops 16b — but the contract decision itself is settled and frozen for the frontend (Amit) to integrate against now.

**(a) Endpoint verb-rename dropped.** `POST /api/v1/mapping-templates` STAYS. It is already correct REST (create a member of the mapping-templates collection); a verb path was considered and dropped because it would split create from its `GET` / `GET {id}` / `PATCH` siblings for no gain. Path and response shape are unchanged from Slice 14b.

**(b) Request contract redesign.** The body changes from a pre-assembled D49 `mapping_rules` document to semantic intent per column: `columns: [{src_key, dest_key, + source-format declarations}]`, where `src_datetime_format` / `src_decimal_separator` / `src_thousand_separator` / `src_is_percentage` are declared only when the value cannot be parsed unambiguously without them. The backend re-derives every catalog/sink fact from `template_type` + `dest_key` — the investigation-proven property that the field catalog is a pure function of those two (`catalog/field_catalog.py` `build_field_catalogs`, `dis_validation.MODEL_BY_TYPE`) — so the request never echoes the sink object; echoing it would be redundant and a drift surface. `dest_key` is the catalog field's `key` for the chosen `template_type`, or the reserved `__ignore__`.

**16a scope (shape only, synthetic 201).** The endpoint shape-validates and returns 201 with a SYNTHETIC `MappingTemplateDetail`: a server-minted but NON-PERSISTED UUIDv7, DRAFT, empty `mapping_rules`, `mapping_version_id=0`. It does NOT write to `config.source_mappings` and does NOT assemble `mapping_rules`. Strictness: body and column models are `extra="forbid"` (a stray key 422s, never silently dropped); `template_type` is a bare `str` checked against the in-code vocabulary in the handler (a clean 400 `InvalidTemplateTypeError`, never a pydantic 422 — there is no schema `Literal`); `columns` is non-empty; format declarations are well-formed-if-present (closed-set separators) but not checked for whether they are REQUIRED for a given `dest_key`. NOT checked in 16a (all 16c): `dest_key` catalog membership, mandatory coverage, target legality, presence pairings.

**Consequence accepted.** From 16a until 16c lands, create persists nothing; a created template cannot be read back via GET/list. Acceptable (pre-production beta, short arc). The create-persistence integration tests are skip-marked "restore in 16c"; the read/patch tests re-seed via a direct admin INSERT rather than through the create endpoint.

**Deferred.** 16b — the new engine ops the declarations imply (e.g. `parse_percent` for `src_is_percentage`). 16c — translate `{src_key, dest_key, declarations}` + `template_type` into the stored D49 `mapping_rules`, run the semantic gate, and write the DRAFT (restoring the skipped assertions). A later separate change may rename the catalog response `key` to `dest_key` for symmetry (out of 16a scope).

**Cross-refs.** D49 (the `mapping_rules` shape 16c will produce), D68 (template grain), D17 (DRAFT lifecycle), Slice 14b (the endpoint whose request body 16a replaces), Slice 14d / D86 / D87 (the type-aware catalog and sink derivation 16a relies on), Slices 16b / 16c (the deferred ops and persistence).

### D90 `POST /mapping-suggestions` is type-aware (optional `template_type`; absent falls back to the legacy union) `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED`. Makes the LLM mapping-suggestion endpoint score against the right per-type field catalog, so the type-aware "Connect a System" CSV branch (which picks `template_type` before mapping) gets suggestions drawn from the SAME catalog its targets come from (`GET /template-mapping-fields?template_type=`).

**The decision.** `MappingSuggestionRequest` gains an OPTIONAL `template_type`. The handler selects the catalog it hands the suggester:
- **Present + valid** (a member of `dis_validation.TEMPLATE_TYPES`): score against THAT type's per-type catalog `app.state.field_catalogs[template_type]` (snapshot included). This removes cross-type noise and makes `snapshot` suggestable at all (the union never contained it).
- **Absent**: fall back to TODAY's exact behaviour, the `app.state.field_catalogs["sales"] + ["inventory_change"]` union (`app.state.field_catalog`). The not-yet-retired `/upload` onboarding flow sends no `template_type`, so it is UNCHANGED. This is a deliberate backward-compat fallback.
- **Present + invalid**: clean 400 `InvalidTemplateTypeError` (`invalid_template_type`), consistent with the other type-aware endpoints.

**Why optional, not required.** The legacy `/upload` flow still calls this endpoint without a type; flipping to REQUIRED now would break it. The fallback becomes dead the moment `/upload` is retired; at that point this **tightens to REQUIRED** (a follow-up). No producer/`GeminiSuggester`/`fallback_matcher` signature change: only the chosen catalog differs. The per-type catalogs were already on `app.state.field_catalogs` (Slice 14d); the union stays on `app.state.field_catalog` for the fallback.

**Scope.** dis-ui-server only (`schemas/mapping_suggestions.py`, `handlers/mapping_suggestions.py`, API_CONTRACT). No persistence, no create-path change. The frontend (Connect a System CSV branch) passes the chosen `template_type`; the old `/upload` caller keeps sending none.

**Cross-refs.** Slice 14d / D86 / D87 (the per-type catalogs this selects among), D89 / Slice 16a (the create contract the same branch wires alongside this), the LLM mapping-suggestion contract (`docs/slices/llm-mapping-suggestion-contract.md`).

### D91 Tenant isolation moves single-GUC → two-GUC (`app.user_type` + `app.tenant_id`) `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (Slice 17b). Realizes D76 and supersedes the single-GUC wording of root CLAUDE.md hard rule 1 and the dis-ui-server "single-GUC / no platform see-all" durable invariant.

**The decision.** All 13 tenant-scoped policies carry an asymmetric two-GUC form: USING = `tenant_id = NULLIF(current_setting('app.tenant_id',true),'')::uuid OR current_setting('app.user_type',true)='PLATFORM'`; WITH CHECK = the NULLIF tenant-match ONLY (no PLATFORM branch — so write-nothing for PLATFORM-no-tenant and write-only-T for impersonation are structural, the deliberate divergence from Customer Master which put PLATFORM in WITH CHECK too). `audit.events` keeps its USING-only outlier (`OR tenant_id IS NULL`, no WITH CHECK) with the PLATFORM branch added to USING. The `NULLIF(..., '')` wrapper lets a PLATFORM-no-tenant session (empty tenant GUC) match no rows instead of erroring on the `::uuid` cast.

**The mechanism.** `dis-rls` sets both GUCs via `set_config(..., is_local=true)`: `rls_session` sets `app.user_type='TENANT'` + `app.tenant_id`; the new `rls_platform_session` sets `'PLATFORM'` with an empty (see-all) or impersonation `app.tenant_id`. Both route through the same first-use `_verified_transaction` posture guard (D93). dis-ui-server reads a REQUIRED `user_type` claim (reject-on-ambiguous); `require_read_scope` gates PLATFORM see-all on `user_type=PLATFORM` AND `dis:ops`; the 6 read methods (mapping-templates ×2, dashboard ×1, quarantine ×3) widen for PLATFORM (stores stays tenant-pinned per D70).

**Fresh == migrated.** Migration `0011` DROP+CREATEs the 13 policies (inline SQL, never `ALTER POLICY`, never edits shipped `0005`/`0007`/`0009`); the 13 `schemas/postgres/*.sql` DDL files carry the same end-state, proven by `test_migration_0011` catalog equality (both directions) + the `tests/contract/test_rls_policy_ddl_text` source-text pin.

**Cross-refs.** D76 (realized), D92 (the request-tenant exception), D93 (the retained lazy guard), D41 (`identity_mirror` RLS-OFF, untouched), D69/D70 (the prior single-GUC posture), hard rule 1 (reconciled). **Scope.** 13 DDL files, migration `0011`, `libs/dis-rls`, dis-ui-server `auth`/`repos`/`handlers`/`schemas`.

### D92 Request-supplied acted-for tenant, PLATFORM-only (controlled exception to tenant-from-token) `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (Slice 17b). The one carve-out to "tenant_id is sole-sourced from the verified token" (dis-ui-server durable invariant; root CLAUDE.md hard rule 1).

**The decision.** `POST` / `PATCH /mapping-templates` carry an optional `acting_for_tenant_id` (internal UUID) in the body. `resolve_acted_for` honours it ONLY on a verified `user_type=PLATFORM` token (the impersonation target). A TENANT request that names an acted-for tenant is REJECTED (403), never silently ignored; a PLATFORM write with no acted-for tenant is a 403; a PLATFORM without `dis:ops` is a 403. The discriminator is the verified `user_type`, never a client-chosen body field; the policy's tenant-pinned WITH CHECK is the structural backstop. Standard impersonation pattern: capability in the token, target in the request.

**Cross-refs.** D91 (the two-GUC posture the write runs under), D76. **Scope.** dis-ui-server `auth/scope.py` (`resolve_acted_for`, `require_write_scope`), `handlers/mapping_templates.py`, `schemas/mapping_templates.py`.

### D93 Lazy first-use role guard retained; no Customer Master boot-guard parity `DEFERRED`

**Status.** `DEFERRED` (Slice 17b). DIS verifies the bypass-role / wrong-database posture lazily on first `rls_session` / `rls_platform_session` use (shared `_verified_transaction` → `_check_posture`, raising `RlsContextError`), not at process start as Customer Master's `engine.py` boot guard does.

**Why deferred.** The lazy guard fires before any tenant data is touched and now covers BOTH session entry points (proven by `test_rls_platform_session_guard`); boot-time parity is a cross-service startup change with no isolation gain for this slice. *Trigger: a future cross-service startup-hardening pass, if boot-time refusal is wanted.*

**Cross-refs.** D91 (the guard both entry points share). **Scope.** none (deferral record).

### D94 Enrichment runs before post-validation (Option A) `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (Slice 5b). The placement of the new `libs/dis-enrichment` step in the streaming consumer.

**The decision.** Enrichment is applied AFTER the mapping engine produces its contribution and BEFORE the canonical-shape (post) validation — between `apply_loaded_mapping` and `run_post_validation` in `orchestrate._process`, gated to `target_model is StoreSkuCurrentPosition`. So enriched values are validated by the canonical-shape suite AND participate in hot completeness. The long-term uniform invariant (every canonical value passes the same quality gate regardless of source) is chosen over the short-term simplicity of injecting after validation at the old `tax_treatment` point.

**The mechanism.** A pure lib (`apply_enrichment`, frame-in/frame-out, no I/O — same purity contract + import-linter forbidden-modules contract + subprocess purity test as `dis-mapping`); the consumer reads the internal source (`read_store_facts`) and hands the facts in. `apply_loaded_enrichment` wraps it the way `apply_loaded_mapping` wraps `apply_mapping`, reusing the original `source_row_indices` (row-alignment contract).

**Cross-refs.** D95 (output-wins + completeness), D98 (tax_treatment migration), D8/D63 (the provenance/completeness levers). **Scope.** `libs/dis-enrichment`, streaming-consumer `pipeline/{fetch,mapping,validate_post}.py`, `orchestrate.py`, `sinks/canonical.py`.

### D95 Enrichment output wins; registered fields become lib-guaranteed `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (Slice 5b).

**The decision.** For a registered field the lib's resolved value OVERRIDES any mapping-produced value (`with_columns` replaces the same-named column). `currency` becomes lib-guaranteed and LEAVES `HOT_REQUIRED_FROM_PROJECTION` (no longer required from the mapping); `guaranteed_hot_columns(current-position)` unions the registry's `enrichment_fields`, so completeness counts enrichment-guaranteed fields and a snapshot mapping that omits `currency` still classifies complete. The lib's contract is source-agnostic: it resolves from an authoritative internal source (`identity_mirror.stores` is the first source wired, not the lib's identity).

**The mechanism.** A new fifth provenance partition `enrichment_produced` (`dis-validation.provenance`) and a relaxed canonical-shape drift guard (`owned ⊆ mapping_produced ∪ enrichment_produced`) — the guard STILL rejects consumer-injected / DB-generated / compute-owned columns (proven by the §8b guard-integrity tests, which bite RED against an accept-anything guard). `currency` stays `mapping_produced` (the lib overrides its value, not its origin); `tax_treatment` is `enrichment_produced`. The lib registry and the provenance partition are kept consistent by a cross-lib drift test.

**Cross-refs.** D94, D98, D63 (completeness lever), D8 (provenance partition). **Scope.** `dis-validation` `provenance.py`/`canonical_shape.py`, `dis-enrichment` registry, streaming-consumer `pipeline/mapping.py`.

### D96 Missing-internal-source-row precondition (generalized) `DEFERRED`

**Status.** `DEFERRED` (Slice 5b). Largely existing behaviour, generalized to the enrichment layer.

**The decision.** Ingestion fails when the internal source row is absent. Today the composite store FK (D39) and the `read_store_facts` read (raises `EventContractError` on a missing store) already enforce it; this entry ratifies and generalizes the precondition to all enrichment. *Trigger: enrichment extends beyond the store, or the precondition is formalized in the lib's contract.* Not built this slice (the existing behaviour stands).

**Cross-refs.** D39 (the FK), D95. **Scope.** none built (record + the existing `read_store_facts` behaviour).

### D97 Field-blank-on-an-existing-source loud-fail guard `DEFERRED`

**Status.** `DEFERRED` (Slice 5b). New guard, not built.

**The decision.** If a registered enrichment field is unexpectedly blank (`None`/empty) on an EXISTING internal source row, fail loud and early rather than write a silent NULL. This slice relies on the current NOT-NULL-on-source reality (`identity_mirror.stores.currency`/`tax_treatment` are NOT NULL) and writes a present-but-blank value THROUGH as-handed-in (the boundary: a MISSING registered field is a caller-contract `EnrichmentError` now; a present-but-blank value is D97 later). *Trigger: a registered field whose source column is nullable, or a hardening pass.*

**Build together with an `ENRICHED` audit stage.** When D97 is built, also add a `Stage.ENRICHED` audit stage and its migration (widen the live `audit.events` stage CHECK vocab + the BQ `stage` description; fresh==migrated) — one change delivering BOTH the enrichment failure disposition (the loud-fail outcome) AND the enrichment provenance breadcrumb. Enrichment emits no audit stage by design this slice (the trail goes `MAPPING_EXECUTED → POST_MAPPING_VALIDATED`).

**Cross-refs.** D95 (the output-wins write), the `apply_enrichment` missing-vs-blank boundary. **Scope.** none built (record).

### D98 tax_treatment migrates to the lib on the current-position path `RESOLVED`

**Status.** `RESOLVED` (Slice 5b).

**The decision.** Under D94, `tax_treatment` moves from its hardcoded consumer injection into the enrichment lib on the current-position path and BECOMES canonical-shape-validated (the `TaxTreatment` enum vocab `{INCLUSIVE, EXCLUSIVE}`) — a deliberate behaviour change from today's unvalidated injection. It is reclassified `consumer_injected → enrichment_produced` for `StoreSkuCurrentPosition` ONLY; on the catalogue write it flows via the projection (no fixed-param injection there), with the INSERT listing it exactly once.

**Event-path status + duplication.** The event models (`StoreSkuSaleEvent`/`StoreSkuChangeEvent`) KEEP `tax_treatment` `consumer_injected` and the event path keeps its fixed-param injection — the deliberate asymmetry (event paths are out of this slice). A temporary duplication therefore exists: `tax_treatment` is lib-resolved on the current-position path and hardcode-injected on the event path. *Removal trigger: when enrichment extends to the event/history tables.*

**Cross-refs.** D94, D95, D39. **Scope.** `dis-validation.provenance` (hot-model reclassification), streaming-consumer `sinks/canonical.py` (catalogue INSERT), `pipeline/validate_post.py` (owned-columns widening).

### D99 Downgrade-reversibility testing deferred until staging `DEFERRED`

**Status.** `DEFERRED` (test-infra only; no migration/schema/service change).

**The decision.** Downgrade-reversibility testing is deferred until staging exists. Pre-staging, staging is provisioned by copying schema+data from dev Cloud SQL, not by replaying migrations, so downgrade has no value yet; the cycle tests also risk stranding the shared local DB at the 0005 multi-template floor (0002/0003/0004 downgrade BELOW 0005 on the shared live DB with no multi-template pre-guard, so a single legitimate multi-template row makes 0005's downgrade refuse mid-cycle and strands the DB at ~0005, poisoning later tests). Upgrade/fresh-bootstrap testing stays. Re-enable the downgrade cycle when staging exists and rollback matters.

**Mechanics.** The downgrade leg in every migration cycle test (0002, 0003, 0004, 0005, 0007, 0008, 0009, 0010, 0011) is `@pytest.mark.skip`-ped with the shared, greppable reason `"downgrade-reversibility deferred until staging (D99)"`. 0002/0003 (whose single function mixed both directions) were split so the apply-to-head assertion stays live; the others' upgrade/fresh-bootstrap coverage already lives in sibling tests. `test_source_mappings_template_grain` has no downgrade leg. (0009's downgrade-to-0008 leg, `test_migration_cycle_departition_and_back`, was initially missed in this list; it was added once it was found to be the residual `source_mappings_v` view-comment dropper — its downgrade traverses 0010's view-dropping downgrade — see D100.)

**Cross-refs.** 0005 downgrade guard (the multi-template floor); D100 (the view-comment leak closed by adding 0009 here). **Scope.** `tests/integration/test_migration_000{2,3,4,5,7,8,9},_001{0,1}.py` (skips + the 0002/0003 split); no migration/schema/service change.

### D100 Suite-level shared-DB clean-state enforcement (resident-worker contamination) `RESOLVED`

**Status.** Resident/test Pub/Sub isolation `IMPLEMENTED`; post-suite clean-state guard re-enabled `RESOLVED` (test-infra only; no migration/schema/service change).

**The finding.** The integration suite ran with resident workers (started by `run_dis_on_local`) that consumed test-published Pub/Sub messages on shared subscriptions and wrote `bronze`/`audit`/`quarantine` rows under real `trace_id`s, AFTER the publishing test's teardown. These rows are owned by no test, so a naive post-suite clean-state assertion false-positived on legitimate resident output (proven: trace `019edbc2`, a full resident pipeline pass — `csv-ingest-worker` RECEIVED→PII→BRONZE→INGRESS_PUBLISHED then `streaming-consumer` RECEIVED→MAPPING_LOOKED_UP(FAILURE)→QUARANTINED). The known Pub/Sub cold-start delivery flake amplified this by leaving published messages for residents to process late.

**The decision.** Suite-level clean-state ENFORCEMENT was DEFERRED until tests and residents are isolated, which makes post-suite state well-defined. **That isolation is now IMPLEMENTED** (option b, structural): integration tests run on a separate emulator Pub/Sub project (`local-dis-test`, set on the pytest process by the `dis-testing` plugin's `pytest_configure` + provisioned by the `_dis_pubsub_provisioned` session fixture; the topic/subscription name set lives once in `dis_core.pubsub_names` and `provision_pubsub`, which `tools/local/create_topics.py` also delegates to), while residents stay on `local-dis`. A resident subscription can no longer receive a test-published message BY CONSTRUCTION — proven with residents up during `make test` and ZERO resident-log activity (vs. the prior contaminating passes). The standing rule stays: a test that mutates the shared DB must revert its own writes (the cleanup idiom). FIX brought the two known direct-write leakers onto it — `tests/integration/test_audit_writer.py` now deletes its `audit.events` rows by trace_id in `finally`; `test_rls_isolation.py` deletes its two `bronze.data_ingress_events` rows per-tenant in `finally`. `test_seed.py`'s default-mapping baseline is left as-is (idempotent, not order-breaking).

**Resolution (guard re-enabled).** The post-suite clean-state guard is RE-ENABLED as `pytest_sessionfinish` in `libs/dis-testing/src/dis_testing/plugin.py` (`_assert_clean_shared_db_after_suite`), gated on `PUBSUB_EMULATOR_HOST` (a bare `pytest` with no stack never fires it) and returning silently if `POSTGRES_ADMIN_URL` is absent. It reads via the ADMIN engine (`ithina_dis_admin`, superuser) which bypasses FORCE RLS, so it sees true state across all tenants (a NOBYPASSRLS session reads RLS-empty and passes FALSELY); `url.database=='ithina_dis_db'`/`url.port==5433` target-safety asserts guard the connection. **All-tables-strict over 9 tables:** the 8 empty-baseline tables (`audit.events`, `bronze.data_ingress_events`, the four `canonical.*`, the two `quarantine.*`) must have `COUNT(*)==0`; `config.source_mappings` must hold no row outside the seeded baseline, matched by (tenant, source, template) from `fx.DEFAULT_SOURCE_MAPPING` — NEVER by `mapping_version_id` (an unstable BIGSERIAL). Failure raises `SuiteResidueError` naming the leaker per category (trace_ids for the 8 tables, offending `source_id` for config). **`identity_mirror` is EXCLUDED:** the resident mirror-sync co-populates it from the real Customer Master (a variable, non-test baseline — 7 tenants / 25 stores locally), so it has no test-vs-baseline discriminator; test edge-stores are reverted by their own teardowns. **`signal_history` stays in the empty set** with no pre-emptive cleanup fixture (D31/D32): the guard correctly fires if a future compute-path test writes it unreverted. **Contract:** the guard asserts the SUITE leaves no residue *starting from a clean reset* (`make reset-local` → `make run-local` → `make test`); it does NOT police accumulated operator/resident artifacts on a long-lived un-reset box (pipeline-check scripts, manual pipeline runs), which a reset clears. Bite-proof tests (`libs/dis-testing/tests/integration/test_d100_guard.py`) confirm a real non-zero-exit failure naming the leaker for both checked categories.

**Cross-refs.** D99 (the downgrade-skip deferral). NOTE: the `source_mappings_v` view-comment contamination was NOT removed by D99's original skip set — it persisted because `test_migration_0009`'s downgrade-to-0008 leg (unskipped in the first pass) traverses 0010's view-dropping downgrade and left the live view comment NULL, breaking `test_fresh_bootstrap` on consecutive runs. It is resolved by skipping 0009's downgrade leg too (now part of D99). The migration-downgrade strand is resolved by D99 as recorded. **Scope.** Isolation: `libs/dis-core/src/dis_core/pubsub_names.py` (`PUBSUB_TOPICS`/`PUBSUB_SUBSCRIPTIONS` + `provision_pubsub`), `tools/local/create_topics.py` (delegates; `main()` unchanged), `libs/dis-testing/src/dis_testing/pubsub.py` (`TEST_PUBSUB_PROJECT_ID`/`pubsub_test_project`/`pubsub_stack_project`), `libs/dis-testing/src/dis_testing/plugin.py` (`pytest_configure` + `_dis_pubsub_provisioned`), the three project-pinned integration tests (`test_ingest_flow.py`, `test_intake_fetch.py`, `test_failure_disposition.py`) and `test_smoke.py` (CM-fake interop pinned to the stack project). Earlier cleanup fixes (kept): `tests/integration/test_audit_writer.py`, `tests/integration/test_rls_isolation.py`. Guard re-enablement: `libs/dis-testing/src/dis_testing/plugin.py` (`pytest_sessionfinish` + `_assert_clean_shared_db_after_suite` + `SuiteResidueError`) and its bite proof `libs/dis-testing/tests/integration/test_d100_guard.py`; no migration/schema/service change.

### D101 Write-time completeness gate derived from the canonical model (Slice 16h) `RESOLVED`

**The decision.** The hardcoded `HOT_REQUIRED_FROM_PROJECTION` literal is replaced by `mandatory_mapping_produced(StoreSkuCurrentPosition)`, promoted to `dis-validation` and shared by the consumer and dis-ui-server, so model/DB nullability is the single source of truth. Pinned to the hot model regardless of routed target; enrichment-supplied fields kept satisfied via the enrichment union (D95). Pure refactor, identical verdicts on all sanctioned paths; the only divergence requires a create-gate-bypassing config row and is strictly safer (INCOMPLETE miss vs a COMPLETE attempt that fails at the DB).

### D102 Enrichment-supplied columns are not mandatory-to-map (Slice 16i) `RESOLVED`

**The decision.** `mandatory_mapping_produced` gains an `enrichment_guaranteed` parameter subtracted from the derived set; callers pass `enrichment_fields(table)` (dis-ui-server gains the dis-enrichment dependency, import-linter-legal). Currency becomes `mandatory=false` at the create gate and field catalog (still present and mappable, not dropped), so the create endpoint no longer 400s when a snapshot omits currency. Closes the create-gate asymmetry deferred from Slice 5b / D95. The partition is unchanged (currency stays mapping_produced; `check_target_legality` still permits mapping it); the write gate is unaffected (currency inert via the guaranteed union).

### D103 unit_cost and product_category nullable on canonical.store_sku_current_position (Slice 16j) `RESOLVED`

**The decision.** Migration 0012 drops NOT NULL on both (the NULL-safe non-negative CHECK on unit_cost is kept); the dis-canonical model marks both Optional; the DDL is synced so fresh==migrated. With 16h/16i in place the create gate, write gate, and catalog flag auto-follow (the three drop to {sku_id, product_name, current_retail_price}) with no gate/catalog code edit. A snapshot omitting these columns classifies COMPLETE and upserts a hot row with them NULL. The current hot-table upsert semantic is omit-equals-preserve (an omitted column is not in the UPDATE, so a prior value is not nulled); the full merge/collision semantic across supplied-empty vs absent is a separate upcoming slice. Surfaced, not fixed: the staging mirror keeps NOT NULL (inert, nothing writes it from the omittable projection); external readers (ROOS, BigQuery/dbt) must honor the null contract when built. Downgrade-reversibility test deferred per D99.

### D104 Mapping-suggester operational knobs as env config (Slice 34a) `RESOLVED`

**The decision.** `GEMINI_MODEL`, `GEMINI_TIMEOUT_S`, and `GEMINI_THINKING_BUDGET` are read in `dis-ui-server` `config.py`: unset means the suggester's built-in default; set-but-empty, unparseable, or out-of-domain raises `DisError` at startup NAMING the variable (`GEMINI_TIMEOUT_S` must be a float > 0 seconds; `GEMINI_THINKING_BUDGET` an int in {-1 automatic, 0 disabled, or positive}, so < -1 rejected). This is the module's FIRST numeric-env precedent (`_optional_float_env`/`_optional_int_env` helpers); the three pre-existing `GEMINI_VERTEX_*`/`GEMINI_IMPERSONATE_SA` reads keep their silent-`or None` behaviour, and their migration to this raise-on-empty policy is DEFERRED (trigger: next slice touching those reads; the live dev semantics depend on an empty `GEMINI_IMPERSONATE_SA`). "Mechanism not policy": defaults live in one place, the knobs are config.

### D105 SDK-level request deadline; the inert timeout wrapper removed (Slice 34a) `RESOLVED`

**The decision.** The suggestion request deadline is enforced at the SDK level via `genai` `HttpOptions(timeout=<ms>)` (the env var is seconds, converted to milliseconds once at client construction). The prior `anyio.fail_after` wrapper — proven inert over the non-cancellable `to_thread.run_sync` worker (D108) — is REMOVED, not kept as a second layer. A deadline hit surfaces as an SDK timeout, caught by the existing `except` and degraded to the mechanical fallback (the handler contract source/model/suggestions is unchanged). **Cross-ref.** D108 (the defect this fixes); D106 (the default value).

### D106 Fast-path defaults when the knobs are unset (Slice 34a) `RESOLVED` (revised, Slice 34b)

**The decision.** With no env override, the suggester runs the improved behaviour: thinking DISABLED (`thinking_budget=0`), a `20.0`s SDK deadline, and the model unchanged (`gemini-2.5-flash`). A bare deploy gets the fast path with no env change. The 20s deadline is a stall guard sized above valid thinking-off latency (it must never convert a slow-but-valid answer into a fallback); the ≤10s latency goal is met by thinking-off itself, not by the deadline. **Cross-ref.** D104 (the knobs), D105 (how the deadline is enforced).
**Revised (Slice 34b).** The unset-default above is unchanged (a bare deploy still gets thinking-off). But the `ithina-dis-cm` dev environment now sets `gemini_thinking_budget = "2048"` explicitly in `dis.dev.tfvars`, so dev runs with thinking ENABLED. Basis: an A/B comparison on a 28-column Italian retail feed showed thinking-on recovered mappings that thinking-off missed (`scmin` → `reorder_point`), and `2048` gave the best recovery of the three settings tested, better than `4096`, which over-reasoned and discarded correct mappings (`lottor`, `in_volantino`), at 14.7s vs 4096's 19.8s (the latter brushing the 20s deadline). "More thinking" is therefore NOT monotonic; `2048` is the chosen operating point for dev. The value is declared in tfvars (not the variable default, which stays `"0"` as the safe fallback), so it survives terraform apply. **Caveat:** the finding rests on one input file; a broader set would confirm `2048` generalises.

### D107 Vertex API + IAM grant applied out of band in ithina-dis-cm (Slice 34a carry-in) `RESOLVED` (partially reconciled, Slice 34b)

**The decision.** Registering an out-of-loop dev fix already applied: `aiplatform.googleapis.com` was enabled and `roles/aiplatform.user` granted to the dis-ui-server service account in `ithina-dis-cm`, which is what moved the dev LLM path from silent-fallback to a working `source="llm"`. **OPEN → Slice 34b (operator):** the terraform reconciliation of this grant (and the stale `GEMINI_IMPERSONATE_SA` env) is not yet in `terraform/`; until 34b lands, CLI-set values drift from terraform.
**Update (Slice 34b).** Partially reconciled. The mapping-suggester env vars (`GEMINI_MODEL`, `GEMINI_TIMEOUT_S`, `GEMINI_THINKING_BUDGET`) are now DECLARED in terraform (`terraform/envs/staging` main.tf + variables.tf, values in `dis.dev.tfvars`) and applied, so those no longer drift. STILL OPEN: the Vertex API enablement and the `roles/aiplatform.user` grant remain out-of-band (enabled/granted directly, not in `terraform/`); they are apply-safe (terraform does not manage them, so an apply does not revert them) but undeclared. The dead `GEMINI_IMPERSONATE_SA`/impersonation wiring in `iam-vertex.tf` is likewise still present, inert via `gemini_dis_sa_email=""` forcing `count=0`. **Deferred to a later slice:** authoring the API in project-services, the direct grant as a resource (then `terraform import` the live grant), and removing the dead impersonation block. Gap 3 (developer grants) was DROPPED, both operators hold `roles/owner`, making the grants redundant; Gaps 4 (apply.sh paths) and 5 (sftpgo `count=0`) were already reconciled.

### D108 anyio.fail_after is inert over a non-cancellable worker thread (Slice 34a defect) `RESOLVED`

**The finding.** Empirically confirmed (anyio 4.13.0): `anyio.fail_after(t)` wrapping `anyio.to_thread.run_sync(...)` does NOT cancel the running worker thread and raises no `TimeoutError` after it completes — a 5s blocking call under a 2s deadline returns normally at 5s. So the suggester's prior 15s "timeout" never bounded the blocking Vertex `generate_content` call; a slow call ran to full completion. **Resolution.** Fixed by the SDK-level `HttpOptions` deadline (D105), which removes the inert wrapper rather than layering on it. **Cross-ref.** D105.

### D109 elapsed_ms additive response field (Slice 34a scope amendment) `RESOLVED`

**The decision.** `MappingSuggestionResponse` gains an additive, nullable `elapsed_ms` (int): the handler measures wall-clock around the whole `suggest()` call, so it reports the model call on the llm path and the failed/timed-out attempt plus the fallback compute on the degrade path (a deadline hit is visible, not reported as ~0). Backward-compatible; the `dis-ui` frontend was verified UNAFFECTED (plain-cast parse, no runtime validator, no exact-shape fixture, no key iteration — extra keys ignored/dropped). **DEFERRED:** structured timing/telemetry LOGGING is explicitly out of scope for this slice (trigger: a future observability slice); `elapsed_ms` is surfaced on the response only, no log lines added.

### D110 First-call client-build / credential path is unbounded in the worker thread (Slice 34a) `DEFERRED`

**The finding.** The SDK `HttpOptions` deadline (D105) bounds only the HTTP `generate_content` call. The first request per process runs `google.auth.default(...)` + `genai.Client(...)` construction + first token mint inside the non-cancellable worker thread with no deadline; worst case, a hung metadata/IAM endpoint on a cold-start request blocks that request. **Not a regression:** the removed `anyio.fail_after` bounded this no better (D108), and building once-per-process (vs every request, as before) is strictly better. **Trigger:** an observability/hardening slice, or the first observed cold-start hang. **Candidate fixes:** eager startup warm-up of the client with its own timeout, or wrapping `_build_client` in a bounded executor.

### D111 dis-ui-server read-set extended to `bronze.data_ingress_events` (read-only) for the runs surface `RESOLVED`

**The decision.** `dis-ui-server`'s documented read-set is extended to include `bronze.data_ingress_events`, **READ-ONLY (SELECT only)**, to serve the Ingestion Runs surface (the `ingestion-runs.html` mockup and the Data Quality runs list). Approved by Sanjeev. A "run" is one ingress execution, and `bronze.data_ingress_events` is the natural grain for it (one row per accepted event, carrying `processing_status`, `received_at`, `dis_channel`, `source_id`, `mapping_version_id`, `source_payload_id`). The BFF reads bronze through `libs/dis-rls` `read_session` exactly like its other tenant reads; bronze's RLS is the standard two-GUC policy (`USING tenant OR PLATFORM`, `WITH CHECK` tenant-pin — identical read behaviour to `quarantine.*`), so the existing `_tenant_term` / scope machinery covers it with no new isolation logic.

**The boundary.** This is a READ boundary only. **The streaming consumer and receivers remain bronze's SOLE writers** (root CLAUDE.md hard rule / this service's CLAUDE.md "NEVER bronze tables (the worker owns bronze)" — a WRITE prohibition, unchanged). `dis-ui-server` never INSERTs/UPDATEs/DELETEs bronze; the runs repo builds `SELECT`-only statements. PII columns on bronze (`auth_principal`, `client_ip`, `user_agent`) and the payload location (`gcs_uri`) are NOT read into the model and never reach the tenant wire (the audit-endpoint discipline, D34-era). **Scope.** Read-set contract change + the runs endpoint (list-only, bounded newest-first); no DDL, no migration, no bronze write path. **Cross-ref.** D34 (audit read, the same read-only-BFF pattern), D91 (two-GUC RLS the scoping rides on), the `bronze.data_ingress_events` DDL header ("Read by: dis-ui-server ingress-history handler").

### D112 `config.sources` source-entity registry (Phase A: table + create/list, standalone) `RESOLVED`

**The decision.** Introduce `config.sources` — the first real per-source ENTITY (today "a source" is only an implicit `source_id` string on `config.source_mappings` rows; there is no source record, and per-source channel/type is unstored, blocking the Upload guard's real-mode `ingestion_mode`, Data Pipelines' Method, and Connector Health's classification). Authorized by Sanjeev (full authority for this L1 work). The table is `(tenant_id, source_id)` PK, FK `tenant_id → identity_mirror.tenants`, with `display_name`, `channel` (reuses the `dis_channel` vocab `csv_upload|api|csv_erp|reverse_api`, NULLable), `store_id?`, `schedule?`, `status` (default `active`), `created_by_user_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `metadata`. It is the **first writable table dis-ui-server owns in the shared DB**: created via a BFF write mirroring `POST /mapping-templates` (`require_write_scope` → `resolve_acted_for`; TENANT pins its own tenant, a body-named tenant is 403, PLATFORM+`dis:ops` writes the acted-for tenant). Two-GUC RLS from the start (mirror the 0011 end-state): `ENABLE`+`FORCE`, `USING (tenant_id = app.tenant_id OR user_type='PLATFORM')`, `WITH CHECK (tenant_id = app.tenant_id)` — the WITH CHECK is the structural backstop that pins every write to the acted-for tenant.

**Scope + deferrals (Phase A).** **STANDALONE** — no FK from `config.source_mappings.source_id` to `config.sources` in v1 (deliberately deferred: a FK would force an alter + backfill dependency on the hot config table and couple the two writes; a later migration can add it once the registry is populated and stable). Migration `0013` applies the DDL (bootstrap-manifest `read_text` pattern) then **backfills** one `config.sources` row per distinct `(tenant_id, source_id)` in `config.source_mappings`: `display_name` humanized from the slug, `channel` best-effort = the most-recent `dis_channel` on that source's `bronze.data_ingress_events` (NULL if the source has no events), `status='active'`; idempotent via `ON CONFLICT (tenant_id, source_id) DO NOTHING`. **PATCH/edit and health/runtime fields are DEFERRED** — connector health (last-seen, missed intervals, rate limit, auth expiry) is worker/poller-produced telemetry, not a BFF write (Phase B, read-only over a worker-written source). A new `SourceAlreadyExistsError` (→409) is added for the duplicate-PK write (no existing 409 error fits; mirrors `MappingTemplateNameConflictError` for the template write path). **Cross-ref.** D91 (two-GUC RLS + WITH CHECK), D92 (`resolve_acted_for` impersonation write), D111 (the read-set precedent), the `create_template` write path (the mirrored discipline).

### D113 Per-attribute change-signal columns on store_sku_current_position, compute_owned (Slice 50a) `RESOLVED`

**The decision.** The current-position hot table gains two nullable `TIMESTAMPTZ` columns — `current_retail_price_changed_at` and `product_name_changed_at` — recording when DIS last observed a change to each attribute (ingest time / `received_ts`, not source/business event time). They are classified **compute_owned** in the provenance registry (`libs/dis-validation/provenance.py`), never `mapping_produced`: "compute-owned" here means **consumer-maintained at write by the catalogue/snapshot path in Slice 50b — NOT a daily-compute job** (no such job exists or is planned for these). Because they are compute_owned (∉ mapping_produced) AND nullable (∉ required), they cannot enter the source-mapped set or the write-time completeness required-set (`mandatory_mapping_produced` → `HOT_REQUIRED_FROM_PROJECTION`), so complete/incomplete routing is unchanged; they are also absent from `catalogue_staleness_columns()`, so `attribute_staleness_map` is untouched. **Scope of 50a.** Adds the columns (schema source, canonical model, migration 0014 with `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, provenance classification) nullable and empty; it writes and stamps nothing. No BigQuery mirror exists for `store_sku_current_position`, so there is no dbt/BQ change. **Dependency.** Slice 50b (the catalogue-upsert maintenance that advances these columns, `IS DISTINCT FROM` inside the event-time gate) DEPENDS ON this entry; the event-route stamping and ingest-vs-event clock reconciliation stay deferred (event routes not operational). **Live note (carried to 50b).** As of 50a there is no ACTIVE `SNAPSHOT` mapping (`config.source_mappings` holds one ACTIVE `template_type='sales'` row), so 50b's stamping is prospective until a catalogue mapping goes live.

### D114 attribute_staleness_map catalogue-path per-column merge + explicit tracked set (Slice 50d) `RESOLVED`

**Why.** Downstream apps need a trustworthy per-(row, column) "last refreshed" signal — some of their decisions change when a value is stale. Today `attribute_staleness_map` on `store_sku_current_position` fails that: it is written only on the catalogue path, **overwritten wholesale** (`= EXCLUDED`, so a column absent from a later, narrower write loses its timestamp), and tracks the wrong set (a `mapping_produced ∩ event_contendable` derivation that includes `currency`/`product_name`/`sku_status`/`promo_identifier` and omits `expiry_date`). **The decision.** Make the map record, per column, when that column was last written, **merged per-column** so untouched columns keep their prior timestamp. On the catalogue upsert the DO UPDATE arm becomes `attribute_staleness_map = COALESCE(store_sku_current_position.attribute_staleness_map, '{}'::jsonb) || EXCLUDED.attribute_staleness_map` (the INSERT arm still builds the map plainly, no read-modify-write round trip), stamped with `received_ts` inside the existing event-time gate, on **write-presence** not value-change — deliberately the opposite of the 50b `*_changed_at` stamps, which stay separate and untouched. The tracked set becomes an **explicit constant** `CATALOGUE_STALENESS_COLUMNS = {current_retail_price, unit_cost, stock_qty, expiry_date}` (the four ingested columns that reach the hot row via the catalogue path today), replacing the retired derivation; the now-unused `event_contendable_hot_columns()` helper is removed. The DDL comment is reconciled and migration `0015` brings the live DB comment to the new set (comment-only, target-guarded, fresh==migrated per the 0005 comment-reconciliation precedent). Value-column writes, routing/completeness classification, and both event paths are unchanged. **Deferred (with triggers).** (1) Event-path stamping — when the event path is operational; it stamps with that path's own clock (`event_ts`, the value it gates on), not `received_ts`. (2) The three compute-owned columns `velocity_7day`/`stock_age_days`/`unit_cost_trend_30day` — when `daily-compute` is built and writes the hot table (attach the same merge helper). (3) `expiry_date` positive-stamp coverage — when a catalogue mapping carrying the `expiry_date + expiry_source + expiry_confidence` CHECK triple exists (this slice proves `expiry_date` only as the never-carried/no-key case, since carrying it would drag a text→enum write onto the value-write path). (4) Staging-mirror comment — `schemas/postgres/staging/store_sku_current_position.sql` still carries the old 7-key staleness comment; it has **no code writer** so it misleads no active path; reconcile it (schema edit + a small staging migration) when the staging table is next touched. **Cross-ref.** D22 (mapping_version pinning), D113 (50b change-stamps, kept separate), D30/D63/D64 (the completeness-gated hot upsert this rides).

### D115 Staleness stamps on non-null value, and the catalogue write distinguishes a gate-rejected no-op (Slice 50f) `RESOLVED`

**Rule.** On the catalogue write, `attribute_staleness_map` stamps a tracked column **only when that column carries a non-null value in the write** — not merely because the column is present in the projected frame. A blank/NULL/absent tracked column **does not stamp**: its prior timestamp is preserved by the per-column merge (D114), and a column never given a value has no key. A re-sent **identical non-null** value **does** stamp — staleness records *last-confirmation-with-data*, deliberately distinct from the D113/50b `*_changed_at` stamps, which record *last-change*. **And:** the catalogue write path distinguishes a **gate-rejected older snapshot** (a new `noop_older` outcome) from an **effective write**, so the counts and the `CANONICAL_WRITTEN` audit `event_data` (`hot_rows_upserted` vs `hot_noops`) reflect reality — mirroring the event path's existing distinction at the source (the upsert returns `noop_older` when `INSERT … ON CONFLICT … DO UPDATE … WHERE` matches nothing, i.e. `rowcount = 0`). The orchestrate-level ack disposition stays `"written"`: a no-op is a *successful* no-op and still ACKs (no nack/redelivery). **Why.** The prior presence-trigger stamped a blank column with a fresh timestamp under the identity mapping — a false freshness signal; and the catalogue path counted a gate-rejected replay as one hot upsert with a `CANONICAL_WRITTEN` — metrics/audit could not tell a rejected older snapshot from a real write. **Scope.** Fix confined to `streaming-consumer` (the `_staleness_stamp_keys` non-null filter in `_catalogue_groups`; the `_insert_on_conflict_hot_complete_path` return-by-rowcount + `write_catalogue_chunk` count). No schema/migration change, no clock change (`received_ts` stays the clock, deferred to Slice 35a), no event-path behavior change (the shared upsert's added `noop_older` is already handled by `write_chunk`; the production event path is the untouched incomplete UPDATE). Also corrects the stale mandatory-set comment in `pipeline/mapping.py` to the runtime 3-set `{sku_id, product_name, current_retail_price}` (post-migration-0012 nullability of `product_category`/`unit_cost`). **Caveat.** The tracked set (`CATALOGUE_STALENESS_COLUMNS`, D114) is all numeric/date today, so a blank cell arrives as `None` and `is not None` is exact; a future **text** column in the set would need empty-string (`""`) handling in the stamp filter. **Corrects.** Slice 50e battery findings 1 (blank-stamp), 5 (stale comment), 6 (no-op over-count). **Cross-ref.** D114 (the per-column merge that preserves the prior key), D113 (50b change-stamps, separate), D59/D64 (event-time-wins gate on `received_ts`), D30/D63 (the completeness-gated hot upsert).

### D116 `telemetry.connector_health` — worker-produced connector liveness/freshness (Connector Health Phase A) `RESOLVED`

**The decision.** Introduce `telemetry` — a NEW schema — and `telemetry.connector_health`, the first **worker-produced telemetry** table in the shared DIS DB, resolving the deferral D112 flagged ("connector health — last-seen, missed intervals, rate limit, auth expiry — is worker/poller-produced telemetry, not a BFF write; a later phase, read-only over a worker-written source"). One row per `(tenant_id, source_id)`, FK `tenant_id → identity_mirror.tenants`, columns `last_seen_at`, `last_error_at`, `last_error_detail`, `auth_expires_at`, `rate_limit_state`, `missed_intervals`, `status` (all **NULLABLE** — a given arrival method emits only the signals it has), `updated_at`, `metadata`. `status` is a CHECK vocab `healthy | stale | auth_expiring | rate_limited | pending`. **Two-GUC RLS** (`ENABLE`+`FORCE`, `USING (tenant = app.tenant_id OR user_type='PLATFORM')`, `WITH CHECK (tenant = app.tenant_id)`) — mirrors `config.sources` (D91). Authorized by Amit (full authority for this L1 work); **SIGN-OFF owed to Sanjeev** — this both adds a worker-written table to the shared DB and **writes into his `csv-ingest-worker`** (the heaviest sign-off yet). Cross-ref D112.

**Producer/consumer split (the load-bearing shape).** The table is **worker-WRITTEN, BFF read-ONLY** — the inverse of `config.sources` (BFF-written). `csv-ingest-worker` emits per run: `last_seen_at=now` + `status='healthy'` on a successful arrival (ingested / duplicate no-op / duplicate resume), and `last_error_at`/`last_error_detail` + `status='stale'` on a failed run (preflight failure), via an idempotent `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (tenant_id, source_id) DO UPDATE`. The write runs on a `dis-rls` `rls_session(engine, event.tenant_id)` connection — the SAME two-GUC / WITH CHECK / no-`.commit()` discipline as the existing `bronze.py` write — so a worker can only stamp health for its own event's tenant. The emit is **additive** to the pipeline (never alters the bronze write path) and **fire-and-forget** (a health-emit failure is logged, never raised into the data path — extending hard-rule-11's audit-telemetry posture to connector-health telemetry; flagged for Sanjeev). The 3 deferred receivers (`receiver-api`/webhook, `receiver-reverse-api`, `receiver-csv-erp`/SFTP) have **no producer** in the repo, so their connectors render **pending** on the surface until those receivers are built.

**BFF read (`GET /connector-health`).** Read-only, mirroring `runs`/`canonical`: `require_read_scope` (verified token only), `read_session` under the two-GUC policy. The read is **`FROM config.sources` LEFT JOIN `telemetry.connector_health` LEFT JOIN a bronze `MAX(received_at)` per-source subquery** (the driving set is the connector registry, so every registered source appears; refines D112/D116's "join to config.sources" phrasing so the coalesce below is expressible). `last_seen_at` is **COALESCE(health.last_seen_at, bronze MAX(received_at))** — an active connector shows real freshness even before the worker has ever emitted a health row. The displayed **status is derived on read** where signals exist (auth-expiry proximity → `auth_expiring`; rate-limit state present → `rate_limited`; effective last-seen older than the staleness threshold → `stale`; fresh last-seen → `healthy`) and **`pending`** where there is no producer and no activity; the worker's stored `status` is a coarse hint, the read is authoritative for the surface. Joined to `config.sources` for `display_name`/`channel` and `schedule` **as a display heartbeat-cadence label** — cadence is **NOT machine-computed** in Phase A (so no precise missed-interval math yet; `missed_intervals` stays worker-emitted-or-null).

**Scope + deferrals (Phase A).** **STANDALONE** — no FK from `telemetry.connector_health.source_id` to `config.sources` (join at read; same deferral rationale as D112's standalone `config.sources`). **NO backfill** — health is live-emitted, not reconstructable from history (unlike D112's `config.sources` backfill). Migration `0016` creates the `telemetry` schema (schema #8, NOT added to the 0001 bootstrap manifest, so fresh(0001..0016) == migrated — the sole-creator invariant D112/0013 established), grants the app role, applies the DDL, grants the table. **Deferred (with triggers):** (1) the 3 non-CSV receivers' emission — when those receivers are built; each stamps the signals it has. (2) Machine cadence + precise `missed_intervals` — when `config.sources.schedule` carries a structured cadence (today it is a free-text human label). (3) `auth_expires_at`/`rate_limit_state` population — when a poller with credentials/rate-limits exists (the reverse-api/api receivers); the columns exist and the read derives from them, but no CSV producer sets them. **Cross-ref.** D112 (health-is-worker-produced deferral this resolves; `config.sources` the join target + the two-GUC/WITH-CHECK write discipline mirrored), D91 (two-GUC RLS), D111 (BFF read-set precedent), D54/hard-rule-1/12 (the worker's `rls_session` write discipline mirrored from `bronze.py`), hard rule 11 (fire-and-forget telemetry posture extended to health emit).

### D117 Ingestion Runs run-state is sourced from the audit trail; bronze `processing_status` is ingress-only; the consumer-advances-bronze design is SUPERSEDED (Slice 51a) `RESOLVED`

**The decision.** The `GET /runs` surface derives each run's VERDICT/counts/completion from `audit.events` (the one completion-truth store), not from `bronze.data_ingress_events.processing_status`. Bronze's `processing_status` is an INGRESS-ONLY signal: receivers/worker set `RECEIVED` then `PUBLISHED`, and nothing advances it further. The bronze schema header + column comment DECLARED that the streaming consumer UPDATEs `processing_status` to PROCESSED/QUARANTINED/FAILED on completion; that write was **never implemented** (the consumer only READs bronze — `pipeline/fetch.py`), so the surface showed every completed run as "processing" forever. This slice **supersedes** that declared design rather than fulfilling it: no new writer advances bronze run state; the manifest comment is corrected to say so. **Why not implement the bronze UPDATE instead:** it would add a second writer to the atomic dual-write path (D30) for a signal the audit trail already carries per-stage (D42/D43), duplicating truth and risking divergence; the audit trail is the system of record for lifecycle. **Scope.** Read-path rework in `dis-ui-server` (handler/repo/schema triplet) + the bronze manifest comment; no bronze write path, no bronze run-state migration. **Cross-ref.** D111 (the bronze read-set this rides), D42/D43 (audit stages/outcomes = the truth), D30 (why not a second bronze writer), D116 (the `connector_health` derive-on-read precedent).

### D118 The verdict crosswalk: precedence over a single defined-data `(stage, outcome)` map, fail-loud, quarantine keyed on the pair (Slice 51a) `RESOLVED`

**The decision.** The run verdict is chosen by fixed **precedence over the verdict-classes present** among the run's INGRESS_EVENT terminal-marking audit events — `succeeded > quarantined > failed`; no terminal-marking event → `processing`. The mapping `(stage, outcome) → verdict` lives in ONE tuple, `schemas/runs.TERMINAL_CROSSWALK`: `(CANONICAL_WRITTEN, SUCCESS)→succeeded`, `(QUARANTINED, SUCCESS)→quarantined`, `(*, FAILURE)→failed`. That tuple is the SINGLE source for BOTH the Python display lookup (`verdict_of`, KeyError→500 on an unmapped pair — no guessed default) AND the SQL terminal-marking predicate / precedence-rank / status-filter CASE (`repos/runs.py` generates them by iterating it), so SQL and Python cannot drift (pinned by a structural unit test). **Precedence, not latest-event:** correctness must not rest on event ordering — `uuidv7()` is only millisecond-monotonic (random sub-ms), so a `event_timestamp`/`id` tiebreak on a same-instant FAILURE-vs-QUARANTINED pair could invert; precedence is order-independent (retry FAILURE-then-CANONICAL_WRITTEN → succeeded; gate FAILURE-then-QUARANTINED → quarantined; pure nack → failed). **Quarantine keys on the PAIR, never on `outcome` alone:** `_emit_quarantined` records `outcome=SUCCESS` (the disposition action succeeded; the FAILURE row already recorded the failure), so reading outcome alone would mislabel a quarantined run "succeeded". **Limitation (registered):** an in-flight run and a stalled/self-healing-nack run are NOT distinguished this slice — a run with only a FAILURE (e.g. `HOT_POSITION_MISSING` awaiting catalogue onboarding, which nacks and self-heals) reads `failed` though redelivery may later succeed; distinguishing them needs a nack/DLQ/attempt signal not in audit. **Scope.** `schemas/runs.py` + `repos/runs.py` + `handlers/runs.py`. **Cross-ref.** D117 (audit-as-truth), D42 (the audit outcome vocab incl. the QUARANTINED-SUCCESS shape).

### D119 The runs counts contract: three independent recorded numbers, one quarantine bucket, path-aware accepted, the sum is never asserted (Slice 51a) `RESOLVED`

**The decision.** Each run exposes three INDEPENDENT numbers, never a forced sum: `input_row_count` = `bronze.row_count` (the payload total, worker DuckDB preflight); `accepted` = rows committed to canonical, read PATH-AWARE from the terminal `CANONICAL_WRITTEN` audit event — `rows_succeeded` on the event path, but `event_data.hot_rows_upserted + hot_noops` on the catalogue/snapshot path (where `event_rows_written`/`rows_succeeded` is 0); `quarantined` = ONE bucket = the `QUARANTINED` event's `row_count` (whole-chunk hold), 0 for succeeded, **null** for failed (a pure nack is not held; the gate FAILURE `rows_failed` is a cell-grain count, deliberately NOT surfaced as a row count) and null for processing. **No accepted/needs-review/rejected three-way split** — the distinction is not recorded (quarantine `status` is a NEW/RESOLVED/DISMISSED resolution lifecycle), so it is not invented (criterion 6). **The response NEVER asserts `accepted + quarantined == input_row_count`:** `input` is the worker's DuckDB-preflight count while `accepted`/`quarantined` derive from the consumer's Polars parse — two independent parsers on the same bytes, equal in the normal case but not guaranteed (trailing newline / quoted embedded newlines / BOM). Criterion 7 ("reconciles OR the discrepancy is representable, not hidden") is met by EXPOSING all three, so any skew (or a failed/processing run's unknown split) is visible. The runs-surface tests assert each number against its INDEPENDENT recorded source (they seed audit directly, so they prove the read composes the numbers, NOT the runtime chain); the runtime chain (written == input on success) is the streaming-consumer's own tests. **Cross-ref.** D117/D118, D30/D33 (append-only writes count deduped rows, so a succeeded run's written count == input), D63/D64 (the catalogue upsert-or-noop path whose counts live in `event_data`).

### D120 File-name capture: additive `csv.received.file_name` + additive nullable `bronze.original_filename`, persisted by the worker at insert (Slice 51a) `RESOLVED`

**The decision.** The uploaded file's original name — parsed by dis-ui-server from the multipart Content-Disposition (`upload_stream.py`) and today DROPPED — is now persisted for the runs surface. Carrier: an ADDITIVE optional `file_name` field on the frozen `csv.received` contract (hard rule 10 coordinated change: schema + example + producer model + worker model + both drift guards), which dis-ui-server populates (truncated to 512, omitted when absent) and the worker persists verbatim into its EXISTING bronze INSERT as a new column. At rest: `bronze.data_ingress_events.original_filename VARCHAR(512) NULL` (migration **0017**, additive/nullable/no-backfill, gated on existence for fresh==migrated parity per the `0006_bronze_template_id` precedent; carries the 0007..0016 target-safety guard). **Not run state, no new writer:** `original_filename` is display metadata (no FK, no index); `processing_status` is untouched and the worker remains bronze's sole writer — this is the slice's single additive write. NULL on pre-Slice-51a rows and when the upload carried no filename. **Cross-ref.** D54 (the `csv.received` trust boundary the field rides), D53/hard rule 10 (frozen contract), D111 (the bronze read-set the runs surface selects it through).

**Deferred (Slice 51a; recorded as triggers, NO D-numbers per convention — a deferral earns a number only when resolved, e.g. D112→D116):** needs-review-vs-rejected split → trigger: quarantine records an accept/review/reject distinction (product decision first); submitter display name → trigger: a cross-module identity read from Customer Master is specced; failure-reason top-N → trigger: the run-detail view slice; rollup query optimisation → trigger: measured latency at real scale; pagination → Slice 51b (immediately next; cursor-vs-offset parked there). See `docs/slices/slice-51a-runs-read-surface.md` Deferred.

### D121 Runs `template_name` is nondeterministic if a template_id ever has differing-name versions; accepted as a lineage-invariant dependency, not hardened in the runs read (Slice 51a) `RESOLVED-as-accepted`

**The finding (adversarial self-validation).** `repos/runs.py` `_template_lateral` is `LIMIT 1` with **no `ORDER BY`**, and no constraint pins `template_name` constant across a template_id's versions — `ex_csm_template_name_per_source` is `EXCLUDE … (tenant_id =, source_id =, template_name =, template_id <>) WHERE status<>'DEPRECATED'`, which forbids two DIFFERENT template_ids sharing a name but says nothing about one template_id's versions differing. So if a template were renamed across a DRAFT/ACTIVE lineage, the runs surface would show an arbitrary one of the names. **Zero such cases live today** (introspected: no template_id has >1 version row), and `template_name` is lineage-fixed by the mapping-templates write path (carried onto chained DRAFTs).

**The decision.** ACCEPTED, not hardened in the runs read: this is a **display-only** nondeterminism that depends on the mapping-templates lineage-fixed-name invariant, and the fix belongs with that component, not with a defensive `ORDER BY` bolted onto the read (hardening the read against another component's invariant is scope creep). The `LIMIT 1` correctly prevents row fan-out either way. **Trigger:** add `ORDER BY mapping_version_id DESC` to `_template_lateral` (show the latest version's name) when a template_id first gains differing-name versions, or when the mapping-templates lineage stops guaranteeing a fixed name. **Cross-refs.** D118, D119.

**Correction to the Slice 51a tenant-predicate wording (D117/D118 posture).** The implementation docstring/plan described the join predicate as "the SOLE isolation on `identity_mirror.stores`". That is **wrong** and is corrected: `store_id` is globally unique (`uq_ims_store_id`) and reached via the composite `bronze→stores` FK, so it cannot resolve cross-tenant — the stores predicate is **defense-in-depth** there (as are the audit and template LATERALs, which key on the unique bronze `id` / `template_id`). The genuinely **load-bearing** predicate is `config.sources`: `source_id` is tenant-shared, so removing its predicate leaks across tenants (proven: 1 joined row with the predicate, 2 without). The code is unchanged and correct — every predicate is kept per the hard-limit posture; only the wording is corrected (in `repos/runs.py`). **Cross-refs.** D91 (two-GUC RLS), D41 (`identity_mirror` RLS-OFF), D112 (`config.sources`).

### D122 Migration tests are isolated to ephemeral scratch databases; the resident dev DB is a read-only reference guarded by a fail-loud session snapshot (Slice 51c) `RESOLVED`

**The decision.** Every migration test drives `alembic upgrade`/`downgrade` against an EPHEMERAL scratch database, never the resident dev DB (5433 / `ithina_dis_db`). The copy-pasted scratch create/drop idiom (present in the 0005..0017 tests) is generalised into one importable harness, `dis_testing.migration_harness` (the `ScratchDB` handle + `alembic_head`/`require_admin_url`/`resident_fingerprint`/`terminate_and_drop`), wrapped as pytest fixtures (`admin_url`, `admin_engine`, `scratch_db`) in the `dis_testing.plugin` pytest plugin. **Fixtures live in the plugin, NOT a repo-root `tests/integration/conftest.py`** — that path resolves to the pytest module name `tests.integration.conftest`, which COLLIDES with `services/streaming-consumer/tests/integration/conftest.py` (that service's test dir carries `__init__.py` but the service dir cannot form a valid dotted package — hyphen — so it mis-roots at `tests`); the same collision that pushed `_dis_identity_synced` into the plugin. **`scratch_db` is FUNCTION-scoped:** tests that drive their own upgrade/downgrade/stamp cycles leave the DB off-head, so a shared module DB would make sibling tests order-dependent; a pristine at-head DB per test removes the coupling. The resident DB is used only as (a) the Postgres server on which scratch DBs are created/dropped and (b) a read-only "migrated" reference for fresh==migrated comparisons — never a downgrade/scratch target; port 5432 is never touched. **AC1 (resident untouched) is proven structurally:** a session guard in the plugin snapshots the resident `(alembic_version, schema fingerprint)` at TRUE session start (`pytest_sessionstart`, before any test/fixture) and asserts it byte-identical at `pytest_sessionfinish`. Fail-loud, never skip: with the stack configured (`POSTGRES_ADMIN_URL` set) the snapshot MUST capture or the session aborts; with no stack it stays silent so a bare `pytest` is green (the plugin convention). The fingerprint is schema+version only (columns/constraints/indexes/policies across non-`pg_*` schemas), so data-writing integration tests don't trip it. **Cross-ref.** D99 (downgrade-reversibility deferred to staging — the downgrade-cycle tests stay skipped, now repointed to scratch), D100 (the sibling post-suite clean-state guard in the same plugin), D123 (the 0013 gate this enables re-running safely).

**Sub-note — dropped per-migration manifest-no-op assertions (coverage trade of the pre-at-head fixture).** The fresh==migrated tests for 0005/0007/0008/0009 previously stepped a scratch DB to revision N-1 (`alembic upgrade 000{N-1}`), captured the manifest-fresh shape, upgraded to head, and asserted the migration was a NO-OP on that manifest-built shape — a per-migration proof that the manifest already carries the migration's end state. The generalised `scratch_db` fixture is brought straight to head, so it cannot expose an intermediate revision, and those specific per-migration no-op assertions were DROPPED. **Accepted:** the at-head `scratch == resident` convergence still holds in every one of those tests, and IT is the load-bearing property — a fresh full-chain build (whose 0001 applies the possibly-drifted manifest) that diverges from the incrementally-migrated resident fails there, so manifest-vs-migration drift is still caught. What is lost is only per-migration LOCALIZATION of a drift (which migration/manifest pair disagrees) — a debugging convenience, not a correctness guarantee. Restoring it would need an empty (not pre-at-head) scratch fixture the test drives itself; deferred as unneeded unless drift-localization is wanted.

**Sub-note — the AC1 guard's schema fingerprint is coarse (accepted; the static invariant is the primary protection).** `resident_fingerprint` hashes `alembic_version` + columns + constraints + indexes + RLS policies across non-`pg_*` schemas. It does NOT capture comments, functions/trigger bodies, view definitions, sequences, enum values, or grants — verified by injection on a scratch DB (a column change flips the hash; a `COMMENT` change does not). **Accepted, not broadened this slice:** the load-bearing protection is the STATIC invariant — every migration test's alembic op targets an ephemeral scratch DB (proven by a full-suite scan), so no test drives alembic on the resident DB at all — plus the `version_num` component, which catches ANY alembic-driven change regardless of the DDL it runs. The schema hash is a secondary backstop for a test that somehow altered resident structure without moving the version; within that backstop it catches the structural changes a migration realistically makes (columns/constraints/indexes/policies) but not comment-only/function-only drift. Broadening it (to comments/functions/views/sequences) is a judgment call deferred to when a need arises, to avoid false-positives on legitimate session-side objects.

### D123 Migration 0013's `config.sources` CREATE is existence-gated for idempotency; only 0013 is gated this slice (Slice 51c) `RESOLVED`

**The decision.** Migration 0013 applies `schemas/postgres/config/sources.sql` verbatim as a multi-statement DDL-file read (`CREATE TABLE` + index + RLS policy + comments). It is now GATED on existence: `upgrade()` runs the file only when `config.sources` is absent (`to_regclass('config.sources')` check), so re-applying 0013 against a DB that already has the table is a safe no-op rather than a "relation already exists" failure — the failure that cascaded across every later at-head migration test whenever a full run re-ran the chain past 0013 (e.g. the 0008 `stamp 0007; upgrade` idempotency proof). This mirrors the existence-gate 0017 uses for its `ADD COLUMN`, applied at the migration-runner level because the file is multi-statement and cannot sit inside a single `DO` block. **`sources.sql` is left byte-identical** (no `IF NOT EXISTS` edits): on a fresh DB the table is absent so the file is applied verbatim — create-on-fresh behaviour is unchanged, and there is no manifest drift (the file is NOT in the 0001 bootstrap manifest — `0001_bootstrap.py` MANIFEST does not list it — so 0013 is its sole creator; the slice's "DDL shared with the manifest" premise did not hold and is corrected). The GRANT and the `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` backfill stay unconditional (both already idempotent). Proven via the REAL alembic path (`stamp 0012; upgrade 0013` on a scratch DB → clean no-op, table byte-identical), not a direct Python `upgrade()` call. **Hard limit: only 0013 is gated.** The isolation work surfaced migration **0016** (`telemetry.connector_health`) as the NEXT non-idempotent migration — its verbatim `CREATE` fails on re-application exactly as 0013 did. Per the slice scope it is SURFACED, not fixed (see the deferred trigger below). **Cross-ref.** D112 (`config.sources` registry), D116 (`telemetry.connector_health`), D122 (the scratch isolation this makes re-runnable), D99.

**Deferred (Slice 51c; recorded as triggers, NO D-numbers per convention):** gating other non-idempotent migrations — concretely **0016** (`telemetry.connector_health`), whose verbatim `CREATE` is not existence-gated, and any further migration a full chain re-run surfaces → trigger: the isolation harness (or a manual `stamp` + re-`upgrade`) fails on a migration's re-application; or staging un-skips the D99 downgrade-cycle tests (which re-run the tail via `upgrade head` and will re-hit these). Each is its own slice with its own trigger. The skipped downgrade-cycle tests were repointed to scratch this slice but not un-skipped (D99); two of them (0004 teeth, 0005 backfill) assert against seeded rows absent on a bare scratch DB and will need scratch-seeding when staging un-skips them. See `docs/slices/slice-51c-migration-suite-isolation.md` Deferred.

### D124 House keyset (cursor) pagination for dis-ui-server list endpoints: an opaque ROW-VALUE-boundary cursor over the (received_at DESC, id DESC) ordering, bounded page size, next-cursor-only, pinned to its issuing filter set (Slice 51b) `RESOLVED`

**The decision.** `GET /runs` is the first paginated list endpoint and sets the house pattern (documented in `services/dis-ui-server/CLAUDE.md`). (1) **Keyset predicate is a ROW-VALUE comparison** `(received_at, id) < (:r, :i)` over the 51a ordering `received_at DESC, id DESC` — NEVER the OR-expanded `received_at < :r OR (received_at = :r AND id < :i)`. Proven by live `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` (50k rows, worst-case boundary inside a 2,000-row same-second cluster, deep page): the OR form is never index-pushed — applied as a Filter that scans from the newest row and discards everything newer than the cursor (43,800 rows removed by filter, offset-like O(page-depth)); the row-value form is pushed into the index as a full Index Cond. A regression unit test fails if the predicate is ever rewritten to the OR form. (2) **Supporting index (migration 0018):** additive `bronze.data_ingress_events (tenant_id, received_at DESC, id DESC)`. With the row-value form + this index the boundary is a full Index Cond, an Index-Only Scan, **zero rows removed by filter, 0.08 ms constant with page depth**; without it the same-second cluster is still filtered (~1k rows removed, heap-fetching, 0.98 ms). The existing narrower `(tenant_id, received_at DESC)` is a prefix-subset kept for now (dropping it as redundant is deferred). (3) **Opaque cursor:** `base64url(orjson({v, r, i, s, w}))` in `dis_ui_server/pagination.py` — carries the boundary `(received_at, id)` plus the issuing filter set (`status` value + `window` TOKEN, never the relative cutoff). Callers echo it, never build/parse it; the version tag `v` lets the encoding change. (4) **Filter-set pinned, fail-loud:** a cursor replayed under a different `status`/`window` is REJECTED (`InvalidCursorError` → 422 `invalid_cursor`), never silently re-based to page 1 (no-silent-fallback); a malformed token is the same 422. 422 is the deliberate house match — a bad cursor is an invalid query-param value on this GET, the same category as a bad `status`/`window` (see `errors_http.py`); 400 is reserved for malformed-multipart/vocab write-path errors. (5) **Bounded page size:** `limit` param, default 100 (= 51a's first page), hard max 100 (the current bound stays the ceiling — never unbounded), over-max clamped, `<1`/non-int → 422 (`Query(ge=1)`). (6) **next-cursor-only:** no `total`/`has_more` (a COUNT over the audit-LATERAL join is expensive); the repo over-fetches `limit + 1` — an extra row means a next page and mints `next_cursor`, else null. The `RunListResponse` envelope gains `next_cursor` beside `items` (the quarantine `open_count` precedent). **Registers the 51a ordering** `received_at DESC, id DESC` with `id` (UUIDv7 PK) as the total-order tie-break as the keyset key (previously stated only in code/slice specs, not the register). **Cross-refs.** D117/D118/D119 (the runs read surface), D33/D38 (read-time ordering + UUIDv7 as the deterministic tie-break), D91 (two-GUC RLS read posture), D111 (bronze read-only), D125 (the `last_updated_at` removal shipped alongside).

**Relative-window behaviour under pagination.** When a time-window filter is active (e.g. `window=24h`), the cutoff (now − delta) advances between page fetches, so a run sitting exactly at the window edge can appear on an earlier page and fall outside the window by a later page (or vice versa). This is correct relative-window behaviour, not a pagination defect: the cursor pins the window TOKEN (`'24h'`), not the moving cutoff, so cursors never false-mismatch across requests. Recorded so an edge-row shifting between pages is not mistaken for a keyset bug.

**Deferred (Slice 51b; recorded as triggers, NO D-numbers per convention):** adopting cursor pagination on the other list endpoints (audit, quarantine, canonical, sources) → trigger: those need to page beyond their fixed limits; dropping the now-redundant `ix_bdie_tenant_received_at` (prefix-subset of the 0018 covering index) → trigger: an index-write-cost review on high-volume bronze confirms no plan relies on the narrower index; switching 0018 to `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` (non-transactional) → trigger: bronze is large enough at cloud-migration time that the brief write-lock matters.

### D125 `last_updated_at` dropped from the `GET /runs` response (and its dead read); `completed_at` is the meaningful terminal timestamp (Slice 51b) `RESOLVED`

**The decision.** The runs response drops `last_updated_at` — an ingress-only bronze signal (D117) that became noise once `completed_at` (the terminal audit event's timestamp) is the meaningful "finished" time. Removed from `RunRow` (`schemas/runs.py`), `_to_row` (`handlers/runs.py`), the repo SELECT (`repos/runs.py`), and the now-dead model mirror (`models/data_ingress_event.py`). The wire-shape change is the field removal ONLY; the SELECT/model drops are internal dead-read cleanup consistent with the model's "faithful read mirror of the **served** columns" contract. **Safe to remove (grep-proven):** `DataIngressEvent.last_updated_at` was read only by the runs read path plus one unasserted test fixture key; nothing logs or otherwise reads it. The identically-named `last_updated_at` on the **canonical** `store_sku_current_position` model/schema is a separate surface and is untouched. **Sole consumer** is `dis-ui-ver2` (whose runs-surface consumption is itself a Slice 51d task), so there is no live consumer of the field today; 51d updates it. **Deploy coordination:** 51b and 51d must deploy so no live consumer meets a response missing a field it still reads (confirm with the frontend owner). The bronze column itself is unchanged (worker still writes it; no migration). **Cross-refs.** D117 (bronze `processing_status`/timestamps are ingress-only), D120 (the 51a additive field), D124 (shipped in the same slice).

### D126 (re-opens D70) second RLS-OFF `identity_mirror.stores` read surface: the canonical explorer's inline store-name join, under the temporary scaffolding posture pending RLS-on (Slice 52a) `OPEN`

**Status `OPEN`, not resolved.** The design choice (inline copy, accepted as temporary scaffolding) is settled for Slice 52a, but this is a LIVE register item, not a closed one: the revisit trigger — bringing `identity_mirror` under RLS — is still outstanding. It closes only when RLS-on lands (the store-read weak link converges, the inline predicate becomes pure defense-in-depth) OR the operator explicitly accepts it as permanent. The next slice must treat it as open.

**Number.** `D126` is operator-assigned at the commit gate — `D126`+ confirmed free against Amit's pulled `origin/main` (its last register entry is `D125`). `decisions.md` remains a shared collision point: explicit-path add, rebase onto `origin/main` before push, keep both entries on any conflict.

**Known residual (accepted for this slice, not a defect).** The only guard against live-schema drift on the canonical surface is the skippable integration test `test_canonical_full_column_set_store_name_bound_and_size` (it derives the expected key set from `information_schema` at runtime and asserts set-equality). The lockstep unit test proves only that the four declaration sites (ORM model, SELECT projection, row schema, row mapper) agree with EACH OTHER, not with the live table. So a unit-only CI run cannot catch a live column added-but-not-served, or served-but-dropped — those surface only when the live-DB integration test runs. Accepted for 52a; revisit if the canonical column set churns or CI stops running integration.

**Context.** D70 resolved that `identity_mirror.stores` reads are tenant-isolated by an in-query `WHERE tenant_id = <token tenant>` predicate (the table is RLS-OFF, D41), and asserted a *single chokepoint*: "the predicate lives in exactly one repo function; no other module queries the store model" (`repos/stores.py`), with a revisit trigger — "Any new tenant-facing read of `identity_mirror.*` re-opens this entry rather than copying the predicate pattern." Slice 52a widens the canonical explorer (`GET /canonical/store-sku-positions`) to attach `store_name`, which is a new tenant-facing read of `identity_mirror.stores` — hence this re-open.

**Two facts recorded.** (1) **An existing un-registered deviation:** the runs surface (`repos/runs.py:228-234`, since Slice 51a) already reads `StoreRow` directly via an inline `(tenant_id, store_id)` outer-join with an inline store-side tenant predicate — outside the `repos/stores.py` chokepoint — and D70 was never re-opened for it. So the "single chokepoint / no other module queries the store model" claim was already stale before 52a. (2) **This slice adds a second such surface deliberately:** canonical's `_build_statement` (`repos/canonical.py`) copies that inline pattern rather than routing through `repos/stores.py` or extracting a shared helper — the operator-approved choice for 52a (no runs refactor, no shared helper).

**Why the copy is safe today (defense-in-depth, not sole isolation).** For BOTH join sites the store-side tenant predicate is belt-and-suspenders, not load-bearing: `store_id` is globally UNIQUE (`uq_ims_store_id`) and the base rows are already tenant-scoped (canonical is RLS ON+FORCE; bronze likewise), so a base row's `store_id` resolves to exactly one store of the same tenant even without the predicate. It therefore has **no behavioural leak signature** — removing it cannot be caught by a row-count/leak assertion. It is kept regardless (the hard-limit posture, D121) and its presence is pinned by a **structural** test that compiles the statement and asserts the `StoreRow.tenant_id == StoreSkuCurrentPosition.tenant_id` term is in the join ON clause (fails if deleted); the behavioural cross-tenant test guards the base-predicate + RLS isolation.

**Convergence that retires this.** Bringing `identity_mirror` under RLS (the deferred RLS-on slice; Slice 17c already seeds `identity_mirror` per-tenant as prep) is the real fix: once the FORCE-RLS / NOBYPASSRLS / GUC posture applies to `stores`, the store read has a database backstop and the inline predicate becomes pure defense-in-depth — the predicate-copy question (chokepoint vs inline vs shared helper) dissolves entirely. Until then these inline copies are accepted temporary scaffolding.

**Deferred (recorded as triggers, NO D-numbers per convention):** a structural shared store-join helper → trigger: only if RLS-on slips far enough that a third convention-enforced predicate copy is a standing leak surface for a meaningful window (redundant once RLS-on lands, so not built now); refactoring the runs surface onto any shared mechanism → same trigger. **Cross-refs.** D70 (the entry this re-opens), D41 (`identity_mirror` RLS-OFF), D91 (two-GUC RLS read posture on canonical), D121 (the hard-limit / keep-all-predicates posture), D124/D125 (the sibling 51b runs-surface entries).

**Slice 52b update (third surface — rule-of-three now firmly met).** Slice 52b adds a THIRD RLS-OFF inline `identity_mirror.stores` read surface: the quarantine console's store-name join (`repos/quarantine.py` `_store_name_join`, applied to both the list legs and the detail statement), copying the same `(tenant_id, store_id)` outer-join + inline store-side tenant predicate as runs (D124/D125) and canonical (52a). Same temporary-scaffolding posture, same revisit-on-RLS-on trigger; `store_id` global uniqueness + tenant-scoped base rows keep the predicate defense-in-depth here too (an FK `fk_q*_store` further guarantees a set `store_id` references a real same-tenant store). The rule-of-three extraction trigger is now FIRMLY met, but shared-helper extraction remains DEFERRED (redundant once RLS-on lands) — see D128. Status stays `OPEN`.

### D127 — persist discarded gate-failure detail into `failure_context.failures[]` (Slice 52b) `RESOLVED`

**Decision.** The streaming consumer previously collapsed each typed gate failure to a 4-tuple `(column, row_index, check, reason)` at three discard sites, dropping the rest. Slice 52b widens the carried `GateFailure` (now a frozen dataclass, replacing the tuple alias) so the offending `value`, and — for the mapping cell-normalization failure — `source_column`, `expected_format`, `transform_index`, survive past the collapse into the quarantine sink's `failures[]` elements. Persisted only where the failure object actually carried them (optional, omitted-not-null; `value` capped at 2048, deliberately WIDER than `check`/`reason` at 256/512, because the value is data a future correction needs whole, not a description). No migration — `failure_context` is already open, nullable JSONB on both quarantine tables.

**The audit/quarantine shared-failures seam.** The SAME failures list feeds both the quarantine hold (now keeps the value) and the audit projection (`_emit_gate_failure`), which stays value-free BY CONSTRUCTION — it reads only column/row_index/check/reason and never `.value`. Pinned by a mutation test (adding `.value` to the projection turns the seam test red) plus a live assertion that the offending value lands in `quarantine.failure_context` but in NO audit event for the trace.

**PII note.** Persisting the offending value assumes no PII is ingested or expected on these sources (CSV beta carries none). Revisit quarantine value-retention if PII-bearing sources are ever onboarded — `value` is the one field that would carry PII if present.

**Cross-refs.** D78 (audit is value-free — the seam this preserves), D128 (the additive read surface that serves this detail).

### D128 — additive quarantine read fields: store identity + structured `failures[]` (Slice 52b) `RESOLVED`

**Decision.** The quarantine `GET` responses gain, strictly additively: `store_id` + `store_name` on BOTH the list and the detail (`store_name` via the inline `identity_mirror.stores` join, D126), and a structured, typed `failures[]` on the DETAIL response only (where `failure_context` is already selected; the list stays lean). `store_name` is null when `store_id` is null/unmirrored. The `failures[]` element type requires only `check` + `reason`; every other per-failure field is optional/nullable (no single failure type carries them all). The `store_id` columns — live on both quarantine tables — are mirrored into the read ORM models (ORM-only, not a migration).

**Additive-only (load-bearing).** No existing response field is renamed or removed — the flattened `error_context` string is unchanged and served alongside the new structured `failures[]`. The dis-ui-ver2 frontend is NOT updated in lockstep, so the wire only grows; a field-set regression test pins that every pre-52b field name is still present.

**Deferred (triggers, NO D-numbers).** The resolve/dismiss write endpoint + resolution lifecycle (columns exist, only a route missing); frontend rendering of the new fields; the shared store-name join helper extraction (see D126 — rule-of-three now met but redundant once RLS-on lands).

**Cross-refs.** D127 (the persisted detail this serves), D126 (the third inline stores-join surface, updated by this slice).
