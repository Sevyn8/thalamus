"""Column provenance: which canonical columns the mapping produces (slice-05 OQ9).

The partial-contribution framing rests on this line: the engine emits the
source-owned, mapping-produced columns; the consumer injects identity
(``tenant_id``/``store_id``), ``trace_id``, ``mapping_version_id`` and the other
write-time columns (D8, hard rule 5, D22). The line was drawn from the LIVE
``ithina_dis_db`` canonical schema (introspected columns + column comments,
slice-05 plan mode), not from DDL files or docs.

The registry carries an EXPLICIT five-way partition per model (consumer-injected,
DB-generated, compute-owned, mapping-produced, and — slice-5b, D95 —
enrichment-produced: canonical values written by the dis-enrichment lib from an
authoritative internal source, NOT the mapping). ``assert_no_drift`` checks the
partition against ``model_fields`` exactly, BOTH directions — so a canonical
column added to the model (the Slice 3 live-schema reconciliation forces that)
cannot silently join any set: it must be classified here or the guard errors.
This guard ERRORS (``SuiteDriftError``), it never skips — criterion 6.

``store_sku_signal_history`` is not mapping-produced at all (daily-compute
output; no ``mapping_version_id`` column exists on it — D22/D31/D32). Requesting
a mapping-time treatment of it raises by design.
