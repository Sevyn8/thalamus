"""The DIS error hierarchy — single ``DisError`` root.

Every error raised by DIS code descends from :class:`DisError`. Define error
types here; don't reach for raw ``RuntimeError`` or ``ValueError``.

This module is **leaf-level** within ``dis-core``: it imports nothing first-party
(no ``dis_core.identity``, no other ``dis_core`` module). Submodules that need
these errors import *from* here, never the other way round, so the import graph
stays acyclic and ``dis-testing`` (which depends on ``dis-core``) can reparent its
test-only errors onto :class:`DisError` without inversion.

The Identity Service client errors live here and are re-exported by
``dis_core.identity`` for backward compatibility, so existing imports
(``from dis_core.identity import IdentityNotFoundError``) are unchanged.

Per-domain errors for the data-plane libs (RLS, PII, storage, mapping,
validation, audit) are added as each lib gains a real raiser; this module
ships the root, the identity errors, and the data-plane errors for
``dis-rls``, ``dis-pii``, and ``dis-storage`` (build to current need).
