"""Auth middleware: extracts JWT, verifies, populates request.state.auth.

Reads `auth_client` lazily from `request.app.state` at dispatch time
because the middleware is constructed before lifespan runs (lifespan
populates `app.state.auth_client`). Constructor injection is not viable
for that reason; lazy access is the FastAPI-canonical pattern.

Public paths (health, openapi, docs, redoc, metrics) skip the JWT check
entirely; `request.state.auth` is left unset for those. Handlers that
must be reachable on a public path therefore must not depend on
`get_tenant_session_dep`, which raises `AuthMissingError` when auth is
absent (per AI-MT-03 source-binding: no auth → no DB session).

Auth failures (AdminBackendError subclasses) are caught here and
converted into JSON responses via `build_error_payload`. We do NOT
re-raise from the middleware: Starlette's BaseHTTPMiddleware does not
route exceptions raised in `dispatch` through FastAPI's
`@app.exception_handler` chain (the exception handler runs INSIDE the
middleware stack, so anything raised in user middleware propagates UP
past it to ServerErrorMiddleware, which returns a generic 500). The
shared `build_error_payload` helper keeps the response shape identical
to the FastAPI exception handler in main.py.
