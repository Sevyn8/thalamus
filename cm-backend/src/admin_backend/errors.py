"""Error class hierarchy for admin-backend.

Step 2.1 introduced bare exception types. Step 2.3 refactors them into
a two-tier structured hierarchy with HTTP-response mapping:

  AdminBackendError
    ClientError    (4xx; subclass-specific public_message is fine)
      AuthMissingError       (401)
      AuthInvalidError       (401)
      InvalidTenantIdError   (401, merges into AUTH_INVALID)
    ServerError    (5xx; ALWAYS returns the generic INTERNAL_ERROR
                   response to clients; specifics go to the log only)
      AppRolePrivilegeError  (was in db/engine.py)

The refactor is backwards-compatible: existing code that does
``raise AuthMissingError("...")`` still works because the constructor
keeps the same signature (a single positional internal_message + **context
kwargs). FastAPI's exception handler in main.py reads ``http_status``,
``public_message``, and ``code`` off the class to build the JSON response.

ServerError subclasses MUST NOT override ``public_message`` or ``code``.
This is anti-information-disclosure: an attacker probing the auth or DB
layer should learn nothing about the internal failure shape from the
response body. Subclasses override only ``internal_message`` (via the
constructor) for log clarity.
