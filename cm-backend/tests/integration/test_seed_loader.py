"""Integration tests for the dev seed loader.

Each test runs the loader (or one of its components) against the
real test DB and asserts on observable database state.

Layer shape:
  L1 — end-to-end run completes without exceptions.
  L2 — per-table row counts match the Excel sheets.
  L3 — sentinel rows: spot-check specific values that exercise the
       trickier load paths (NULL translation, audit-actor synthesis,
       per-row routing, ltree paths).
  L4 — production-refusal guard: settings.environment == "production"
       returns exit 2 with no DB writes.

Note on RLS visibility (D-29). All six multi-tenant tables use the
unconditional PLATFORM OR-branch, so a PLATFORM session sees every
row. Post Step 6.8.1 split (D-34), the previously-mixed
``user_role_assignments`` is gone; it lives in two physical tables:
``platform_user_role_assignments`` (no RLS) and
``tenant_user_role_assignments`` (RLS+FORCE, unconditional OR-branch).
PLATFORM-without-impersonation now sees every assignment row directly
in either table.
